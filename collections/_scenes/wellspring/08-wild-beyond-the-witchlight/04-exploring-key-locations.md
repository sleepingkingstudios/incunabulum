After licking their wounds from battling the elusibe lobster-like aberration, the Silverstone Players continued their journey through the south of Hither, where they came across a wide valley filled with the demiplane's ever-present fog. Roya bravely volunteered to test the mists for magical hazards; safety rope tied about her waist, she ventured forward into the valley and caught a glimpse of a central hill looming out of the vapor.

Although wary of the magical mist-filled valley in the realm of the fey, the Silverstone Players forged onward. As they ventured into the valley, a great hill rose up out of the mists ahead, dotted with willow trees that swayed gently back and forth despite the still and stagnant air. Undeterred, they continued to the base of the hill, where two of the trees uprooted themselves and strode forward to bar the party's way.

The animated trees stated that Telemy Hill is a place of refuge, and asked for the party's purpose there. Told that the Silverstone Players sought the goblin who lives here, the trees replied that the goblin is a friend, an odd recluse who wears a coat of keys. She made her home in a cave atop the hill, which she has not left for a few days now. The Silverstone Players reassured the trees that they have no quarrel with the goblin, and were escorted by the animated willows up the trail to near the peak of Telemy Hill, where a key-shaped opening was carved into the hillside.

Inside Telemy Hill, the party found a round cave filled with dangling keys and a single goblin, still bearing the marks of an attack and weak from lack of food. The goblin introduced herself as Jingle Jangle, referring to herself as such in the third person henceforth. When told of the party's mission to free Sir Talavar, the goblin quickly agreed in exchange for some water and trail rations. She explained that she had been attacked by the harengon brigands while gathering truffles, and had not dared leave her home since. Jingle Jangle warned the Silverstone Players that the brigands, lead by Agdon Longscarf, watched all paths to and from the bullywug village of Downfall from their lair in the Brigand's Tollway, a series of wooden catwalks that circle a giant tree stump.

Her true grudge, however, was with the wicked hag Bavlorna Blightstraw, whom she had mistakenly asked for help in lifting a perceived curse. Instead, the hag enchanted the goblin to be compelled to collect keys, leading to her present sorry state. The hag makes her home in Downfall, ruling over the resentful bullywogs and using the harengon brigands to terrorize the rest of Hither on her behalf.

At last, Jingle Jangle found the correct key, hanging on a line from the cave's ceiling, and unlocked Sir Talavar's golden cage. The faerie dragon knight was deeply grateful; while he could not promise the aid of his patron the Summer Queen in resolving the situtation in Prismeer, he assured the Silverstone Players that they had earned the favor of the Summer Court. On his own behalf, he bestowed upon his rescuers his magic sword.
