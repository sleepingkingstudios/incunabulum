  Seeking a key to unlock Sir Talavar's cage, the Silverstone Players venture across the realm of Hither. As they ford the river, they are attacked by a giant lobster-like aberration.

The Silverstone Players' next task was to free Sir Talavar from his enchanted cage. Fortunately, the cage's key had been stolen from the Bavlorna Blightstraw by a local goblin. Listening to the hag's ranting thereafter, Sir Talavar learned that the goblin's name was Jingle Jangle, after the keys she hoarded, and that she made her home atop Telemy Hill in the far south-east of Hither.

Following the diminutive dragon's directions, the party trudged eastward through the swamp, coming to a shallow river that meandered its way north across the demiplane. Wide but shallow, the river itself looked to be little obstacle to any but Roya, but sharp eyes spotted something large hidden beneath the slow-moving waters. Feeling cautious, the Silverstone Players elected to journey some distance upstream before attempting to ford. After a further half-hour's journey, they chose to try and cross the river near a stand of willow trees that grew up out of the current.

As the party reached the halfway point across the river, their unseen adversary attacked, emerging from the mud with a great wave knocking each member down, Sir Talavar from Verity's hands, and Roya from Py's shoulders. As the Silverstone Players regained their feet, looming over them was a hulking lobster-like aberration, green-shelled and eyeless, with enormous pincers on its segmented arms and flailing tentacles about its maw.

Though caught on the back foot and hindered by the water, the party engaged the aberration in battle. Unnoticed by the creature, Roya swam upriver to the stand of willows, using her magical slippers of climbing to find a solid perch from which to strike the beast with arrows. Verity gathered Sir Talavar in his cage and retreated toward shore, using her bardic magic to empower her allies, while Py drew her wrench and engaged the monster at close quarters. Mo struck the beast with magical fire; finding the sightless aberration drawn to magic, she narrowly avoided its grasp with an arcane shield before retreating toward shore. Py remained to contest the beast wrench to claw, narrowly avoiding a painful fate as it grasped her in its oversized claws, but another barrage of arrows and flame proved too much for it. With a final threat display, the aberration dove beneath the mud once again.

Battered, the Silverstone Players reached the river's far side and then paused to catch their collective breath.
