Slogging through the swamp until midday in pursuit of the crashed balloon, the Silverstone Players reached a crumbling stone tower, leaning at such an angle it threatened to topple over and surrounded by vicious black briars. Hanging from the tower was the tattered remains of the balloon, its wicker basket dangling precariously over the thorny vines.

As the party approached, a hissed voice called out to them for aid. Mo sent her familiar to investigate, finding a sword-bearing faerie dragon in the basket, trapped in a golden cage; his companion, a bullywog, did not survive the crash. The dragon gave his name as Sir Talavar and pleaded with the characters for their assistance, as a pair of enormous snakes were nesting in the brambles.

Roya attempted to sneak through the briars to the tower undetected, but caught the attention of one of the serpents instead, which immediately attacked the interlopers. The Silverstone Players engaged it with crossbow and magical flame, while Roya used her packet of pixie dust to fly up to the basket and rescue Sir Talavar. Meanwhile, a second snake emerged from behind the group, attempting to wrap its coils around Verity. The battle descended into a brawl, with Verity and Py each engaging a serpent with rapier and wrench, and Mo and Roya defending them with spells and arrows. A lucky bolt of fire to the eyes brought down the first snake, while Py coated her wrench in an unstable alchemic concoction and struck the second with a mighty blow, finally driving it off.

With Sir Talavar saved from the basket but still trapped in his cage, the Silverstone Players took a few moments to catch their breath and ask the diminutive knight some questions. Sir Talavar declared himself an emissary of Titania, the Summer Queen, sent to enlist the aid of the powerful but aloof archfey Zybilna. Unfortunately, on his arrival he found that Prismeer had been taken over by the Hourglass Coven, a trio of hag sisters who split the domain into three realms. Zybilna herself was trapped in her own palace, frozen in time from the power of Iggwilv's Cauldron.

Sir Talavar was captured by one of the hags, Bavlorna Blightstraw, and trapped in the cage. Unfortunately, a goblin stole into the hag's dwelling and stole the key; from her ranting after, he learned the goblin's name was Jingle Jangle, and he lived east of the tower atop Telemy Hill. The hag also placed some sort of magic on the cage; Verity attempted to break the enchantment, but was unsure if she was successful, and Mo found a lingering aura of abjuration still clinging to it. He managed to convince one of the Bullywogs (his pilot Wigglewog) to help him escape, but the balloon was damaged and crashed into the tower. Still trapped in the cage, he offered the party his magic sword in exchange for their aid in securing his freedom.
