Passing through the enchanted mirror, the Silverstone Players found themselves atop an enormous broken stone causeway, which stood nearly a hundred feet above a fog-drenched swamp and beneath an alien twilight.

As the adventurers got their bearings, they spotted a great patchwork balloon spinning out of control, wicker basket swinging wildly; it plunged into the fog perhaps a mile to the east. Intrigued, both Mo and Py sent their respective familiar servants to investigate, but neither Sophie nor Py's homonculus servant could find anything in the fog save the occasional glimpse of some great shadow lurking ahead. With the sun going down, the Silverstone Players chose to make camp atop the causeway.

An hour before midnight, the swamp below abruptly flooded with water, turning hills and gnarled treetops into islands in a stagnant sea. A few hours later, the water drained equally abruptly, restoring the swamp to a damp morass of mud and tangled vegetation. Roya spotted dancing lights around a small stone structure far off in the distance, while Py saw the silhouettes of some enormous creatures soaring through the sky and Verity a small band of human-sized figures hopping through the swamp.

The following morning, the Silverstone Players carefully descended the causeway, finding a path of carven handholds and sturdy mushroom shelves. With the morning sunlight shining dimly through the dank mists overhead, they set out east in search of the crashed balloon.
