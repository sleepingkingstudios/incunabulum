The Silverstone Players found travel difficult in the swamp, with deep patches of mud hidden beneath the grass and tangled clusters of foliage blocking what passes for a path, while the ever-present and shifting fog made navigation a trial.

As they struggled forward, a marching song of sorts began to sound out of the fog:

> With sticks and stones, we'll break your nose;
>
> We'll beat you blind and steal your clothes.
>
> But none among us can compare
>
> To one wily, swift, and stand-up hareâ€”
>
> Scarf that's glorious, thief notorious,
>
>His deeds are truly meritorious!
>
>With a wink and a grin, he'll show his cunning;
>
> A flash of his scarf, he'll take off running.
>
> Quick as a bolt, his long scarf trailing,
>
> Gasping, grasping, you'll end up flailing.
>
> You'll pout, you'll moan, you'll huff, you'll sneer;
>
> Thanks to Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer!

The party quickly found themselves confronted with a band of a half-dozen Harengon brigands with a giant pack snail in two, their rabbit-like features and jolly bearing contrasted with their business-like clubs and slings. As the two groups came to a halt, the Harengon leader stepped forward. She introduced herself as Jebbek, and announced that this was a robbery. She demanded that each character surrender the feeling of delight they remember from when they were given the best gift they ever received, and threatened to beat them black and blue if they refused.

The brigands were surprisingly talkative, and showed a particular deference to Verity, whom they recognized as the Witchlight Monarch. When questioned, Jebbek replied that this was the realm of Hither, and that the Harengon served their fearless leader Agdon Longscarf, but that all here were ruled by the hag, who she would not name for fear of drawing the hag's attention; the hag keeps her residence in Downfall, among the Bullywogs, and Jebbek gestured north along the causeway. Jebbek also remembered when Prismeer was one realm, not divided into three (the other two realms are Thither and Yon). When asked about Zybilna, she replied that that name was now forbidden in Prismeer.

With the brigands' patience running thin, Jebbek demanded again the characters grant her the memory. In response, the party readied their weapons, with Py drawing from her bag a wrench larger than any of the bandits. Reconsidering, the Harengon fled into the fog.
