Having come to an accord with the harengon at Brigand's Tollway, only the native dangers of Hither now stood between the Silverstone Players and the village of Downfall, lair of the hag Bavlorna Blightstraw. As they navigated through the mists, however, the sparse woods began to take on an ominous appearance - tree branches like skeletal limbs, screaming faces in patterns in the bark. Collectively deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, the party retreated just in time, spotting shambling humanoid figures moving through the mists. With the hour growing late, the Silverstone Players began to search for a place to rest. After avoiding some enormous, multi-legged entity that crossed ahead of their path, they made camp atop a sturdy hill crowned by a ring of banyan trees.

Dawn rose on their third full day in the Feywild, and the Silverstone Players resumed their journey. Wandering wide around the haunted woods, as the party crossed a mist-veiled field of grass and cattails they came across a band of fellow travellers - hobgoblins on stilts with baskets on their backs, collecting eggs. Though busy with their own errands, the hobgoblins conversed briefly, confirming the direction of Downfall and warning that the party would need stilts of their own, or some sort of water-borne conveyance, to reach the bullywug village.

After fashioning a crude but serviceable raft, the Silverstone Players resumed their trek.
