  Ambushed once more by the lobster-like Chuul, the Silverstone Players instead make an unexpected friend.
---

From Telemy Hill, the Silverstone Players began their journey toward the hag's lair and the bullywug village of Downfall, and returned to the wide river that cuts Hither in twain. Remembering the fierce aberration they battled before, the Silverstone Players were cautious of the water and its denizens.

Their wariness was swiftly rewarded, and Verity spotted the aberration's lobster-like shape moving silently beneath the water a short distance upstream. The beast was undisturbed by a quick bowshot, but the first scent of Verity's magic drew it like a bloodhound. Still, the visibly scarred aberration had learned caution after its first narrow escape, taking a snap arrow from Roya as it emerged at a distance to spit a geyser of boiling swamp water at Verity; it then dove back beneath the fetid river to evade retaliation.

Verity called upon bardic magics, her full powers of persuasion, and her grant of royal privilege, and commanded the beast to halt in the name of the Witchlight Monarch. Astonishingly, the creature did, moving slowly away upriver before emerging to snap its claws in confusion before vanishing beneath the river mud once more. As the bard moved to cross the river, however, it emerged directly beneath her, tossing Verity into the air and onto the creature's back before running to the far side of river with its terrified passenger. The remaining Silverstone Players were left to trudge their way across.
