  The Silverstone Players confront Agdon Longscarf, brigand prince of Prismeer, and his merry band of Harengon bandits.
---

The Silverstone Players trudged their way through the misty marsh, coming at last to the harengon's village of Brigand's Tollway - an enormous tree stump rising out of the stagnant waters, surrounded by a spiderweb of narrow wooden paths above the swampy muck. Grateful for a chance to dry their feet, the party climbs up onto the network of wooden paths and begin to navigate toward the central trunk. As they travel, however, sharp-eyed Py spots an intruder amongst the group - Agdon Longscarf himself, trailing his long sky-blue scarf and carrying a red-hot brand. Delighted at his trick, the leader of the harengon bounded about the wooden paths, took a moment to bow mockingly to "her majesty" Verity, then posed dramatically with a brace of his brigand followers at his back.

Chastened somewhat by the recent defeat of his followers, Longscarf seemed to view the Silverstone Players as a peer power in Hither, but remained bound by a bargain made with the hag Bavlorna Blightstraw, to whom he insultingly referred as "Slack-Jawed Lorna". Despite his bravado, Verity could sense that Longscarf was secretly terrified of the hag, who had charged the harengon community with two tasks. First, to protect the approaches to her lair in the village of Downfall to the north-west; second, to collect a toll of emotion from any visitors to Hither, used to fuel the hag's magic. To that end, Agdon Longscarf demanded of each of the Silverstone Players a tribute for the hag - either a trinket with sentimental value, or an emotional memory, such as the taste of their favorite food, or the first time they met a close friend.

The Silverstone Players negotiated with Agdon Longscarf. Chief among their concerns is their friend Jacaranda the pixie, to whom Longscarf regarded as a "menace", and regaled the party with the story of the pixie leading the village's children in "a daring raid on the treasury". However, the harengon feared the hag's wrath should she return and her "gift" be missing. Calling on her bardic talents, Verity communicated silently with the brigand leader, offering their support in removing Bavlorna Blightstraw's stranglehold over Hither. To give the brigands cover, the Silverstone Players agreed to relinquish a shared memory - the taste of distilled "magic bean" elixir, taken together with an absent friend. The memories were collected using an enchanted horn.

From here, Longscarf greeted the Silverstone Players as guests, inviting them to speak with the pixie within the harengon village. He added as an aside that he had heard the name Verity once before, from a traveller who passed through before the Hourglass Coven usurped the realm of Prismeer...
