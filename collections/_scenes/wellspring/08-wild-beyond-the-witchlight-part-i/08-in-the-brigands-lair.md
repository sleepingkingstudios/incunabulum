  In the Harengon's lair inside the Brigand's Tollway, the Silverstone Players reunite with their missing pixie friend.
---

The Silverstone Players are welcomed into the harengon community at Brigand's Tollway. Inside, they are reunited with the missing pixie Jacaranda, holding court over a rapt audience of harengon youth from inside a fancy silver birdcage. With Verity's ability to translate with the pixie exhausted until the following sunrise, the Silverstone Players are forced to bargain with the young harengon to provide translation in exchange for candy.

With some effort, the Silverstone Players managed to extract Jacaranda's story while dodging pickpocket attempts from the precocious apprentice brigands. She had been captured by one of the three thieves when entering the carnival without a ticket. Taken to "the mean lady", whom the party inferred to be the hag Bavlorna Blightstraw, the pixie was locked in the enchanted silver birdcage and given to the harengon as a "gift". Being the agent of chaos that she was, the visibly-unchanged Jacaranda then proclaimed that the mean lady had turned her into "a spider". When asked delicately by Mo if the pixie perhaps meant "a spy", Jacaranda replied that the mean lady said a lot of things, but she wasn't really paying attention.

The pixie's attention span visibly waning, the Silverstone Players managed to ask a handful of pertinent questions. Jacaranda did not recall seeing or hearing anything about an alicorn while in the clutches of the hag. She also did not believe that this was her home of Prismeer, insisting that Prismeer was a big, fancy castle.
