The Silverstone Players continued their journey across the realm of Hither. As they traveled north-west, the swampy ground gave way to a deep, flooded marsh, slowing their voyage further. As the sun hit its mid-day peak in the mists above the weary travellers, they heard the sound of oars striking the water somewhere ahead. Uncertain as to whether the sound was from friend or foe, Py called out into the fog that the Witchlight Monarch approached. From the swirling mists emerged a pair of longboats, rowed by the roving harengon brigands of Hither. Now greatly outnumbering the Silverstone Players, the brigands demanded the party pay the toll as intruders. Verity attempted to scare off the bandits once more, but feeling confident in their numbers, the harengon were undeterred.

Seeing no alternative to battle, the Silverstone Players struck the first blow. Verity gathered her will and shattered one of the boats with an arcane word and gesture, while Mo cast a fireball into the second, rendering it a burning ruin. As the surviving brigands leap into the water, they are pursued by bolt and arrow from Py and Roya; however, they quickly regroup, returning fire with a barrage of sling bullets and whirling daggers. While the Silverstone Players were distracted, a pair of enterprising harengon attempted to ensnare Verity with a weighted net. However, another barrage of arrows and magic eroded what remained of the brigand's courage. The harengon dove beneath the water and began swimming in all directions, while their erstwhile leader emerged behind a floating piece of rubble and waved a once-white cloth.

The brigand lieutenant engaged the Silverstone Players in a cautious parley; unfortunately, she had little new information to share about the harengon or about Hither as a whole. However, as she agreed to warn the rest of the brigands that the party were powerful foes, the harengon noted that they were nearly as strong as the adventurers in "the pixie's" stories. At the Silverstone Players' urging, the brigand explained that less than a moon ago, the hag gifted Agdon Longscarf a pixie in an enchanted cage.

Suspecting the caged pixie to be their missing friend Jacaranda, the Silverstone Players decide to head to the haregon settlement at Brigand's Tollway and resolve the bandit situation once and for all.
