The Weeping Shrine is a large chamber crafted of carefully-fitted masonry and great windows of stained glass, lit from behind as if by sunlight; it is said that each Upwelling, the images depicted in the windows change. The shrine consists of two areas. First is a long rectangular section lined with stone pews, some 30 feet wide and 60 feet long, with an arched ceiling 30 feet above. At the far end of the pews, the chamber opens up to an octagonal space, with a ceiling half again as high and framed by seven tall windows of stained glass. One a raised dais at the center, a stone statue of humanoid shape stands 30 feet fall, hands over its face. Despite its size, the statue is too roughly shaped to identify a species. Some delvers have claimed that the statue weeps a reddish fluid, either blood or a weak potion of healing.
