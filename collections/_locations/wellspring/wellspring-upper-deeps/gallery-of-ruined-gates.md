The Gallery of Ruined Gates is one of the largest landmarks in the Upper Deeps. It is comprised of a large domed chamber well over a hundred feet in diameter, carved from solid stone with consummate skill. The Gallery is named for its gates, carved by the ancient giants millenia ago to connect to distant lands and even other planes of existence. The circumference of the gallery is lined with crumbling gates, once free-standing stone circles twenty feet or more in diameter and now little more than rune-carved rubble, although a few appear to be nonfunctional but nearly intact.

Four gates still stand on pedestals around the chamber's center, connected by stone bridges to a central platform. These gates replicate in microcosm the mutability of the Upper Deeps, and stand in different positions relative to each other and the central platform each time the gallery is rediscovered. Two gates stand in eternal opposition, while one moves slowly around the perimeter and another seemingly at random. Thus far, attempts to measure or demonstrate the gates' movement have had no success, nor have attempts to repair the broken gates or discern their destinations.
