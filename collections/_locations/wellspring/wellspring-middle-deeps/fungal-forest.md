The Fungal Forest is a network of interconnected caverns, home to a small civilization of friendly Myconid. The mushroom folk are wary of outsiders until they have proved their intentions, but welcoming hosts for those they consider friends. The forest is well-named for its proliferation of mushrooms, from tiny multi-colored caps on the ground to giant towering shrooms the size of large trees. The air in the forest is humid and thick with spores.

Although magicite is rarely found in the Fungal Forest, it is a popular waypoint for delvers who seek a safe place to rest and recover from the dangers of the deeps. Enterprising delvers can sometimes find large clusters of glittershrooms, a valuable alchemical reagent used for potions both legal and illicit.

The myconid village itself is set into the sides of a rift in the stone, stitched with wooden bridges and festooned with hanging baskets filled with luminous fungus. At the bottom of the rift is a deep pool of stagnant water.
