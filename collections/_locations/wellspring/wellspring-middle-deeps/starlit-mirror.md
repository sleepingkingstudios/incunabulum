The Starlit Mirror is an enormous underground lake at the periphery of the Fungal Forest. The arching ceiling of the cavern far above is spotted with brightly luminescent mushrooms; reflected in the still waters of the lake, they resemble the stars in the night sky. A few delvers with knowledge of astrology have speculated that the reflected lights may reflect the actual stars as seen from different places or times.

The shallow end of the lake holds a community of tortles, who have a treaty with the nearby Myconid settlements and assist in moving rafts across the lake. The deeper end of the lake is said to hold beasts both hostile and strange, and descends to unknown depths beneath the mountains.
