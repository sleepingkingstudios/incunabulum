An unusual landmark connecting the upper and middle deeps below Wellspring, the Inverted Stair takes the form of a spiraling staircase of finely carved stone and immense length, turned upside down as if in some great cataclysm. In addition to the inherently treacherous footing (the underside of stairs not, generally speaking, being meant for traversal), the entire edifice stands tilted ten degrees off of vertical, and lay crumbling in sections, creating a hazard of loose stones and falling masonry.

Through some unknown magic (possibly the same effect that inverted the stairs themselves), the space inside the stairs seems upside down relative to the rest of the Deeps. While there is no noticeable transition when entering or exiting the stairs, in order to descend lower into the Deeps, a party of delvers traversing the stairs must actually *climb* for a considerable distance; likewise to return closer to the surface a party must instead descend.

It is said that descending the stairs all the way leads to an observation post of sorts, carved from the raw stone high at the peak of one of the mountains surrounding Wellspring. Climb the stairs far enough, in contrast, and the way will be barred by a magical shield of unknown origin, likely the same barrier that bars passage beyond the far Deeps.
