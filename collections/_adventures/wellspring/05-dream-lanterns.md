Verity is contacted by Myria Quill, editor of the *Wellspring Watchman*, who asks Verity to interview a local woman on her new enchanted device. At the Watchman's offices, she is introduced to her interview subject, one Margritte Gramont. Margritte is a human woman approaching middle age, wife of a local shipping magnate; she makes extensive use of cosmetic glamours, lending her a fey appearance.

In contrast to Verity's dogged scepticism, Margritte waxed rhapsodic about her new device, called a Dream Lantern. Simply by setting the lantern by the side of the bed at night, Margritte was able to turn a lifetime of nightmares into dreamless sleep. That said, the circumstances were certainly suspicious - Margritte was unwilling to share just where she had gotten the lantern, saying it was through a referral from "a friend of a friend". The only other detail she could recall is that her instructions were to ensure she was the first one to open the lantern, to ensure that it bonded properly to her.

Unsettled, Verity returned after the interview to the Silverstone Theater and consulted with Mo regarding her knowledge of dream magic. Mo only recalled that certain creatures were known to interact with dreamss, mostly aberrant psionicists such as Mind Flayers.

The following day, the Silverstone Players split up to canvass their various contacts. Py reached out to Richart the nephew of the copper trader and Lavinia the alchemist; neither were aware of a new entity manufacturing magical items. Lavinia added that potions for calming dreams were rare and unreliable, more herbs and fairy magic than proper alchemy.

Mo inquired with his contacts at the Arcane Order. While she was unable to learn more about the Dream Lanterns nor their mysterious creators, she was approached by Ebard Skolnikos, a fellow student of some acquaintance. Ebard asked if Mo had found any unrefined magicite during her adventures, and suggested that he had a contact who was buying magicite under the table, no questions asked.

Roya made the long journey up the mountain to the Celestial Observatory, where she met Cyrene in a meditative garden that featured rolling stone orbs representing the four moons. Cyrene was initially excited, asking if the theater was in danger again, or if the Silverstone Players were preparing to go on a delve. When asked about dream magic, however, she became uncharacteristically closed off. Dream magic was very dangerous, allowing a skilled practitioner to access and manipulate the subconscious mind.

Worse, the study of dream magic in any form was forbidden among the Watchers of the Stars. Cyrene related a story from a few decades back of a full Astrologian that tried to use dream magic to predict the motions of the moons. That sister vanished so thoroughly that no memory of her remained - only an empty office with a handful of partially burned notes, and an apprentice who had no memory of learning from a mentor.

Verity's interview appeared in the Watchman as part of a larger profile on Margritte and her husband. None of the skepticism or caveats made it into the published article. The Silverstone Players discuss the possibilities, with Roya suggesting the connection with a shadowy noble cabal implies the involvement of Brother Nocturne once again. Py and Verity discuss the possible connection to fairy magic, which Roya recalls can often involve enchanted sleep.

With none of the group conversant in the magic of the Wild arcanum, the party reached out to the Delver's Guild. Asking their usual contact Mialee, she suggested that the local experts on fairy magic would be the druidic circles living deep in the Bronzewood. Unfortunately, they would need a guide, and none was presently available, although she would happily forward on the party's information if one should come through. Roya recalled that some of her relatives lived in or traveled to and from the halfling communities in the Bronzewood, and might serve as an intermediate step.

While at the Delver's Guild, the party also inquired about open contracts. While most were of little interest, such as hunting monsters in the Undercity, the party did accept a contract from a giant from the nearby Choir of Shaped Stone. The giant, an aspiring runesmith, wished for an escort within a few tendays to visit the Gallery of Ruined Gates and study the works of her ancient ancestors.

As the sun touched the peaks high above Wellspring, the Silverstone Players set out to the Bronzewood in search of the druids. The morning is spent travelling down Wellspring Vale, the long valley that slopes down from the city to the lowlands. They passed through a patchwork of farms, orchards, small villages, and coppiced trees, and saw work crews digging a canal to link Wellspring with the capital.

Shortly after midday, they turned off the main road and headed north, following the path to the Bronzewood. The ancient forest half-filled a valley of its own, looking deceptively small but growing larger the farther in one travels. They reached the edge of the trees as the sun is going down, and decided to stay at a rustic-looking tavern called the Old Saw Inn.

The inn was fairly busy, and the party split up to speak to different groups. Py approached a group of trappers, who decided to prank the city folk with tales of "Grenchlers", invisible six-legged lizards that are warded off by whistling and putting foot lotion behind the ears. Py also asked them about visiting the druids, but the trappers never ventured that far into the woods. They also mentioned a treaty with the elves.

Mo talked to a pair of wood elves, named Sunlight Through The Leaves and The First Snowflake Of Winter. They warned that finding the druids would be a very difficult journey for city folk; the druids live even deeper into the forest than the elves, close to the boundaries of the fey realms. The two elves strongly recommended that Mo not attempt the journey without an experienced guide. They also expressed surprise that the fey woudl meddle in city affairs, and suggested that a mortal practitioner might be responsible.

Inquiring about the treaty, Mo is told that the druids use nature magic to make the whole valley fertile, and with the elves prevent dangerous creatures from wandering in from the deep woods or the fey realms. In exchange, no tree or animal is to be harmed beyond the Treaty Stones. Mo accepted an offer of berry wine, only to find the wine magically fortified and herself quite intoxicated.

Verity spoke to the two inkeepers, Mika and Michel, who were surprisingly not twins despite their close resemblance. The two aren't sure if the druids are real, but suggest that she could probably find a practitioner of nature magic in any decent-size community in the Bronzewood. Thinking of her missing family, Verity also asked about stories of travellers wandering into (and more importantly, back out of) the deep woods. The two recalled that the old owner user to tell stories of fair folk travelling through long ago, but if those were more than stories the fey have long since stopped coming to visit.

> Date: [17 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning, the party reconvened and shared stories. Mo struggled to be patient during her hangover with Py's naivete over the "Grenchlers". Roya in turn was furious, both on behalf of her friend and out of wounded professional pride - as a guide, telling that sort of tall tale to impressionable travellers deeply offended her. She asked Py to fashion her a pair of stilts, while she gathered curved sticks that looked like a supposed "grenchler's" teeth. Waiting for the party of trappers to depart, she used her wind magic to hide herself from sight, then scared the group witless with a masterful impression of the imaginary creatures.

With Py's credulity avenged, the Silverstone Players continued on into the Bronzewood. Around midday, Mo spotted a lone figure with a heavy axe pacing back and forth by the side of the road ahead. Although concerned, the party approached openly, and the man half-ran down the hill to meet them. Seeing that the travellers were well-armed, he introduced himself as Pierre the woodman, and asked them for help fighting a trio of giant-kin that had besieged his logging camp. The other loggers had distracted them long enough for Pierre to run for help, but he did not know how long the palisade would hold.

The Silverstone Players agreed to assist, and asked Pierre some questions as he led the party off the road. Pierre was from Wismar, in the Free Cities; his group of woodcutters made camp in the same place each season, looking for golden oak trees. Golden oak wood appeared to have veins of metallic gold running along the grain of the wood, and was highly prized for furniture making. This year there were six other woodcutters in the group, lead by the half-elf Ameé.

As the group approached the woodcutters' camp, Mo sent her familiar Sophie to scout ahead, finding a low hill ringed by a damaged log palisade. One dead ettin giant-kin had fallen at the foot of the walls, festooned with elvish arrows. Two more stood arguing in broken giantish under the trees nearby; the gist of the dispute seemed to be "wooden hill strong" against "meat inside, must crush". Pierre warned that none of their weapons would pierce the giant-kins' hides; still, the party agreed that the ettins must be killed or driven off.

Thus resolved, Mo and Py advanced to within range of spell and crossbow, while Verity crept close enough to lay a laughing curse on one of the giant-kin. Unfortunately, Roya's attempt to strike the ettins from above ended in disaster, falling from a tree nearly on top of the surprised monsters. With one ettin laughing helplessly on the ground, the party launched a volley of spells and crossbow bolts at the other. Roya used the distraction to land a precise blow with her rapier, while Mo used her divination magic to manipulate probability and keep the trapped giant-kin from breaking the laughing curse. However, the wounded ettin retaliated with mighty swings of its stolen axe, striking Roya several times. Verity attempted to enchant the giant-kin, but failed in the face of its berserker rage. Mo struck it with a barrage of fire magic. Finally having enough, the ettin struck Roya one final time before it turned and lumbered into the forest.

Verity advanced forward to heal Roya, while Py launched another volley of crossbow bolts at the fleeing giant-kin, bringing it down with a bolt to the back of its head. With the other ettin still afflicted by Verity's curse, both Roya and Verity landed telling blows with their rapiers, finally breaking the enchantment. Mo struck the giant-kin with several bolts of flame as it regained its feet. It then stomped its foot hard enough to shake the ground, but both Roya and Verity managed to stay on their feet. Verity took a blow from its clubs but retaliated with a fear curse, prompting the ttin to flee in terror and take blows from both Verity and Roya. A final pair of bolts from Py's crossbow brought the second ettin down for good.

Pierre invited the Silverstone Players inside the palisade. The leader, a half-elf named Ameé, thanked the group for their aid, and introduced them to a pair of wood elves that had also come to the group's assistance, bringing down the first of the three ettins. Mo spoke to the two, named "A Leaf Dances On The Breeze" and "Water In The Bubbling Brook", with the former translating the latter's signing. The two warned that it is difficult to reach the druids in the deep woods without an invitation and a guide; the routes change often. However, most local communities will have a greenmage or spirit speaker, who might be able to help them with their questions about fairy magic. While Py spoke to the foresters, Verity also spoke with the elves, asking about people who vanished into the fey realms. She was warned that those who travel too far unprepared to not return. Finally, the party asked the pair about the Treaty Stones. The elves explained that no two of the stones are alike - some rise about the trees, and others are nestled under tree roots. However, the character of the wood changes unmistakably on the far side of the stones.

The Silverstone Players take advantage of the fortification to rest and recover some of their strength. As they prepare to resume their journey, Ameé thanks them again and gives them a small clay pot holding a *potion of treant strength*. Not too long after returning to the road, they turn off once again to follow a stream toward their destination, the halfling village of Shadepool.

The party arrive at Shadepool that evening. The community is quite a sight, built around a large earthen dam. The local undine (halflings with a water bloodline) live in the reservoir, while the gnomes (halflings with an earth bloodline) and a handful of others live in sturdy cottages or burrows in the surrounding hills. Strangely, there was a large area cleared of trees beside the reservoir, with a few temporary buildings going up beside it.

The Silverstone Players were greeted by Orryn, the shirrif of Shadepool. He told them that if they are there for the carnival, they are a month too early. Confused, they were handed a flyer, beautifully hand-illustrated and bearing the invitation "Mister Witch and Mister Light invite you to their carnival of magic and mystery, whimsy and wonder." The name strike a chord with Py, who recalled from her youth that the Witchlight Carnival is famous (or infamous) among the travelling folk, visiting any part of world only once every eight years. She had a very vague memory of seeing it once as a child, but the recollection is hazy and dreamlike.

While fascinating, the carnival was not the reason for the group's visit, and at Roya's request the group was lead to the house of her great-aunt Verna, who works as the local apothecary. Her house was a crooked multi-level cottage; each of the three floors was tilted a different direction, and the chimney intermittently puffed a purple smoke. Great-Aunt Verna welcomed Roya and the rest of the group inside, although the halfling-sized dwelling was a little uncomfortable for the rest of the Silverstone Players. When asked about the carnival visiting, Verna suggested the party speak to the town's council.

The Silverstone Players were served a dinner of watercress soup and fresh bread, but right before Py took a sip an eyeball floated to the top of her bowl. As she stared at it in shock, the eyeball suddenly burst into a flock of rainbow butterflies that scattered about the room before evaporating. Exasperated, Verna stomped up the stairs to grab her wife Euphemia and drag her into the dining room with a few well-placed whacks with the soup ladle. Euphemia introduced herself as a greenmage, a scholar and practioner of nature and fairy magic. Puffing her pipe (which blew spiraling multi-colored smoke), she asked why the group had come to visit.

The party prevaricated, making vague claims about fairy magic at work in Wellspring and their responsibility as members of the Delver's Guild to keep the city safe. When they gave a few details, Euphemia was deeply alarmed by the reference to dream magic at work. She warned that magic involving dreams can be insidiously dangerous, but any number of things can cause nightmares - curses, possession, even indigestion. The greenmage shared a story about a local who was possessed by an astral parasite that caused terrible nightmares; fortunately, a circle of druids was able to drive it out. Regarding the dream lanterns specifically, she asked an intriguing question: "Where are the dreams going?" However, magical artifacts were not her area of study, and perhaps more answers could be found in the city.

Knowing that Verity had questions of her own, Py grabbed Mo and asked Roya to show them around the gardens. Now alone with the greenmage and apothecary, Verity asked her own questions about people disappearing into the fey realms and shared some of the story of her brother Honor and his journal. Euphemia warned that the Feywild had many dangers; if Honor had indeed made a bargain with some denizen, it could serve as a powerful protection but also leave him trapped.

> Date: [18 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning, the Silverstone Players debating their next move. Verity asked about continuing on to visit the druids, but the party was advised that was a journey that could potentially take several tendays - they might be able to return before the carnival arrived, but they would have to abandon their task in Wellspring to escort a giant below the city. They resolved to return to Wellspring for the time being, and hopefully return in time for the Witchlight Carnival.

Before departing, the party had a few more questions for Verna and Euphemia. There are no easier ways to travel back and forth between Shadepool or Wellspring - as Verna pointed out, if they wanted to be closer to the city, they'd live there. On the topic of practitioners of dream magic, they were told that no two dabblers were alike. That being said, dream magic had a corrosive effect on the mind. Those affected could sometimes act as if there were multiple people in their heads, lose time, or even start to fade from the memories of people around them. If they suspected the use of dream magic, Euphemia strongly suggested they write everything down.

The Silverstone Players also inquired about the Witchlight Carnival, and were directed to a member of the Shadepool's town council, an undine named Pearl. She shared some charming details - apparently, the emissary from the carnival had arrived in town on the back of a giant swan carrying a howdah. She also mentioned offhand that space was cleared by Euphemia, who literally sang the trees out of the ground to create a large enough clearing.

Getting back on the road, the party makes it back to the Old Saw Inn that evening. The innkeeps Mika and Michel have a mixed reaction to the coming carnival, with Mika indifferent but Michel excited at the chance. Also staying at the inn is a trade caravan making a stop in the Bronzewood on its way between Lothian (the capital) and Wellspring. Py strikes up a conversation with the caravan master, who tells her he is carrying fine woodwork and textiles from the Free Cities, and is looking to exchange some spices for fresh foods from the local communities. He also has a crate of religious icons he picked up from an eccentric contact in the capital, and invited Py to take a look the following morning.

> Date: [19 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

As promised, Py looks over the caravan's goods. The woodwork and textiles are much too expensive for theater work, but the religious objects are of more interest. Most are either simple carvings or gaudy trinkets meant to look authentic, but Py picked out three items of interest. First was a stamped iron plate with a toothed wheel, which the merchant claimed had been forged by a high priest of the Mother of Machines in the Free City of Gerlon. Second was a simple silver pendant shaped like an open book, the symbol of the Librarian. Third was what the merchant claimed was a genuine holy relic, a small square of leather said to be part of a scabbord wielded by a famous paladin of the Knight-Errant. Mo quietly cast a spell to detect magic, and at her urging Py also added a simple-looking carved wooden acorn, which radiated a faint aura of transmutation magic.

The caravan and Silverstone Players parted ways, and the journey back to Wellspring was tiring but un-eventful.

> Date: [20 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning was a rest day in Wellspring, and the streets were busy with shoppers and revelers, including a parade of people flying kites shaped like crimson fish. Shortly before noon, a visitor arrived for Py - it was Brother Lucian, for whom she crafted and repaired simple prosthetics for those in need. While Py worked on repairing a damaged prosthetic he had brought, Brother Lucian mentioned that several of the city's well-to-do citizens had come by the clinic, seeking help for their waking nightmares.

One of the patients was so afflicted that she was sheltering in the clinic's back room, unable to sleep and seeing things moving in the corner of her eyes. Brother Lucian found himself at something of a loss - she was not afflicted by any sort of disease or poison that he could identify, nor was she subject to a curse. Oddly enough, she kept asking him for a lantern, despite the fact that the room was brightly lit. Brother Lucian asked Py and her friends to let him know if they heard of any similar cases, or anything that could help the poor soul in his charge.

The priest also took a look at the religious symbols Py had purchased, having something of an academic interest in the "false" deities of the pantheon despite his faith in the Sun Goddess. Before he left, Py asked if they could visit the patient at the clinic, to which Brother Lucian assented so long as the patient was willing to receive company.

After Brother Lucian departed, the Silverstone Players discussed their options and decided to split up and consult with their various contacts in the city. Py and Roya set out towards Brother Lucian's clinic, while Mo headed to the Arcane Order to investigate the magicite black market and Verity went to solicit a follow-up interview with Margritte Gramont.

The clinic was a sturdy building of whitewashed stone, built in a run-down part of Wellspring's Old City district and festooned with bright golden symbols of the Sun Goddess. Py and Roya were quickly welcomed inside, and while Py started to set up her tools Brother Lucian went to check on his patient. He returned a minute later, and announced with alarm, "She's gone!" He lead Py and Roya to a storeroom at the back of the clinic; as they walked, Roya asked if the woman had left anything behind, to which Brother Lucian replied that she had left her clothes and cloak, and was wearing a set of borrowed acolyte robes.

The storeroom was something of a mess; the window was broken out, with a battered chair on its side at the window's base. A strange symbol was crudely scribed on the wall in yellow paint, looking like an opened eye surrounded by a multi-tailed spiral. Some investigation revealed additional details: the window had clearly been broken out from the inside. There was a discarded can of yellow paint behind an overturned bench, and a discarded rag with a smear of yellow paint. Based on how dry the paint was, the symbol had been inscribed several hours before, likely shortly after Brother Lucian had left to visit the Silverstone Theater. Finally, outside the window was a narrow alley, with visible footprints in the discarded refuse. Unfortunately, the trail was lost once it rejoined the busy street beyond.

Looking at the symbol itself, Brother Lucian was unable to identify its origins despite his extensive knowledge of religious iconography. Py and Roya decided to make a copy and take it to the Delver's Guild, in the hopes that someone could identify it.

Meanwhile, Mo found his "buddy" Ebard celebrating his good fortune at the Pointed Cap, traditional apprentice's hangout near the Arcane Order. As he ordered Mo an Everburning Flask cocktail, the clearly intoxicated Ebard happily answered Mo's questions. He had made a sizeable amount of gold brokering the sale of magicite to the Harfoot Syndicate, with whom he had previously had a relationship selling stolen potion ingredients. Mo pretended to drink her own cocktail, earning a dirty look from Pierre the tiefling bartender, while Ebard knocked his back and ordered something green. Served a Lamia's Kiss, Ebard continued that his contact with the syndicate was named Portia, although the last name escaped him. It was something like "Dumbthistle", or "Downthistle"; something night-related and something plant-related.

With that, Ebard blacked out. Mo dragged him to a booth and took the chance to search her fellow student's pockets, finding a small coin pouch along with an answer sheet for an upcoming quiz. On the back of the answer sheet was a cryptic note, including a date (the 22nd of Unicorn, two days hence), a time (two bells before midnight), and the word fragment "-under".

As Py and Roya went to the clinic and Mo to the Arcane Order, Verity headed to Margritte's townhouse in the Garden District. She introduced herself to the footman, stating that she wanted to a follow up on her previous story; after a few minutes, she was invited inside to the salon, where she found Margritte artfully draped over one of the couches. The woman stated her appreciation for Verity's profile in the *Watchman*, and was happy to answer her follow up questions.

Verity's keen eyes noticed that despite her apparent ease, Margritte had bags under her eyes that were incompletely covered over by cosmetic glamours. When pressed, Margritte admitted that she'd started to have nightmares again. However, the nightmares had changed - now she saw shapeless figures around the edges of her vision, or an impression of nameless things watching her through the walls. When she asked about a second lantern, she was told the enchantments would conflict.

At this point, Margritte apologized for being a poor host, and offered Verity refreshments. She accepted, and also asked if she could see the lantern for herself. At Verity's request, the socialite brought the lantern down from her bedroom. The lantern was just short of a foot tall, composed of delicate bronze and frosted glass. One side of the lantern was hinged. Otherwise, the lantern seemed fairly mundane; pointedly so, and it tended to slip beneath notice unless actively concentrated upon.

Verity asked a few follow up questions of Margritte. The socialite had purchased the lantern at a salon held by one of her friends, who had requested anonymity. She doesn't know who else from her social circle might have bought a lantern. She does recall, however, that she was told no less an august personage than Dame Savindar had purchased one of the artifacts.

Meanwhile, Py and Roya continued on to the Delver's Guild. While their usual contact Mialee is out, they find the archivist Morana Durthane nursing an ale at a table half-covered with parchment; she was happy to answer a few questions as a distraction from dealing with old accounting records. When shown the symbol from the clinic, however, the archivist was unfamiliar with it, and suggested talking to the Arcane Order if the party suspected the symbol might be magical in origin. She also pointed out that the party could place a bounty on the guild board in search of more information.

While still at the Delver's Guild, Roya also asked about maps to the everchanging terrain beneath the city, with her eye on the upcoming contract to escort a giant to the Gallery of Ruined Gates. Unfortunately, the recent upwelling had scrambled the local topography; Morana suggested trying again in a tenday, when more delving parties had reported back.

The Silverstone Players reconvened that evening and shared their stories. Concerned that Dame Savindar might be affected by her lantern, Verity sent her a cryptic note via the Delver's Guild:

> We urgently need to talk. You're in danger. Under no circumstances should you open the lantern.
>
> -- Verity of the Silverstone Players

Meanwhile, Mo sent her familiar with a message to Cyrene at the Astral Observatory:

> Update on the matter we discussed most recently. Is this symbol familiar? Let us know when we can meet.

The Silverstone Players then departed together to the Arcane Order to consult with one of Mo's instructors, Professor Wim Spence. They found the professor having a nightcap "to warm his old bones", but he was happy to answer some questions for one of his favorite students.

While the professor was unfamiliar with the symbol itself, he suggested that both the opened eye and the spiral are related to mind magic in traditional symbology. Given the context of a traumatized young woman, he suggested that the symbol could either be generated by the experience itself, or something that the person saw and associated with the trauma. Unfortunately, he suggested that the priest would be better able than he to identify a curse, a poisoning, or demonic possession. As for other types of possession, Professor Spence recalled that some creatures were known to influence the mind, such as illithids or so-called mind flayers.

Finally, the party asked about dream magic. While a rare topic of study, the professor recalled that one of his collegues, one Professor Estelle, had studied dream magic perhaps a decade ago. She apparently left the academy some time thereafter. Oddly enough, another student came to him a few months ago, also asking questions about dream magic. The students name was Jasper something-Thistle.

> Date: [21 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following afternoon, the Silverstone Players received a curt missive from Dame Savindar. The message invites the group to meet her at the [Five Fingers]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/city-of-wellspring#the-five-fingers) that evening, a semi-legitimate fighting club in the Undercity. In the meantime, the party decide to return to the Arcane Order to investigate mind magic, and perhaps find clues as to what the missing student Jasper was studying.

The library of the Arcane Order set in a tall tower, but extends upward farther than the tower itself should allow. Access to the library is restricted based on level of experience and tenure within the Order, with apprentices restricted to the first two floors without special permission from an accredited magus.

The Silverstone Players were met at the library by its keeper, the half-elf Parsival Lemoine, who maintains the books alongside an army of bound imps. Fortunately, Mo was a student in good standing with the librarian, and he was happy to answer a few questions while carrying around a stack of books taller than his head. Less fortunately, books on mind magic (beyond basic charms and enchantment) were available only with the specific permission of a senior instructor.

On a hunch, Mo also asked Parsival about the former student Professor Spence had mentioned, one "Jasper something-Thistle". Here, the librarian was able to be of more assistance, recalling "young Jasper Thistledown" as a precocious apprentice. Parsival recalled that the young halfling had started calling themselves "Jasper Dreamthistle" shortly before they dropped out. Jasper had asked about some of the same books on dream magic that Mo mentioned. He was also careless with his books, doodling strange symbols in the margins, "creepy things with lots of eyes".

From there, Mo continued on to the bursar's office, a gruff dwarf named Albrect. The bursar was less than helpful, confirming to Mo only that Jasper was no longer a student at the Order.

Meanwhile, Py went to speak with her contact within the Harfoot Syndicates, Marigold of House Greentea, under the pretense of selling some magicite under the table. Marigold reminds Py that, legally speaking, magicite can only be sold to the Arcane Order or its authorized representatives. Py continues, however, mentioning that she believed a Syndicate house was buying magicite illicitly.

Marigold reluctantly confirmed this, but advised against doing business with House Dreamthistle - if Py was really short on money, some of Marigold's associates would be happy to offer her a very reasonable loan. Asking about House Dreamthistle, Py learned they were relatively new and very secretive, sending a representative to the Syndicate council only a few months ago.

Py also showed Marigold the strange symbol that had been painted on the side of the clinic by Brother Lucian's mystery patient, to which Marigold expressed surprise that any Syndicate iconography should be displayed in the Old City. It was also curious, Marigold said, that Py came asking questions about House Dreamthistle and then showed her their symbol.

That evening, the Silverstone Players reconvened and then descended into the Undercity to the infamous Five Fingers club, where Roya managed to convince the door guards that Dame Savindar had already paid their entrance fees. Inside, the club was shaped like an ampitheatre, with a central arena ringed by benches; farther out were tables for patrons to sit and a bar with assorted spirits. Amidst the guests were servers and a number of bookies taking wagers on the fights; the noise was a raucous blend of shouts and cheers, and the air thick with ale, sweat, and the smoke of torches and various recreational herbs.

In the central arena, a single silver-haired human woman was fighting barehanded against a trio of armed and armored giants, and holding her own with panache. While the patrons were distracted by the brawl, Roya noticed a pickpocket working the crowd and stepped away for a quick conversation; the other halfling warned that the drinks were watered and that at least half of the fights were fixed.

The masked fighter (Dame Savindar herself behind a thin veneer of plausible deniability) finished off her last opponent, ripping his helmet off his oversized head and beaning him with it to the roars of the crowd. Following the match, she disdained the infirmary to hold court at the bar, where the Silverstone Players managed to work their way through the crowd of her admirers.

Dame Savindar was glad the party got her invitation, though she disdained the more cautious members' desire to move the conversation to a more discreet locale. With no alternative, Verity warned the legendary delver that she had been gifted a very dangerous artifact. Dame Savindar was unimpressed, and replied "You're going to have to be more specific. People give me a lot of shit."

Still trying to talk around the nature of the dream lanterns, Py asked if Dame Savindar had recently purchased a nightlight. That prompted recognition at last, followed by anger as the party explained that others had been claiming an endorsement for the lanterns.

Dame Savindar reassured the Silverstone Players that she hadn't provided that endorsement, not had she even opened the lantern she had been given. Considering the party's clear interest, she scribbled an illegible note on a bar napkin and told the party to present it to her steward in the morning. With that, Dame Savindar proclaimed that a good evening required a good drink, a good fight, and a good tumble, and went off in search of the three giants she had defeated.

> Date: [22 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

The following morning, the Silverstone Players went to Dame Savindar's manor in the Noble Quarter. As promised, her steward (a man named Vallentin) accepted the illegible bar napkin with a look of familiar exasperation, but was happy to answer a few questions.

He assured the Silverstone Players that the lantern should be untouched, and sent one of the servants to retrieve it. The cursed item had been a gift, allegedly from one of Dame Savindar's old adventuring friends named Appleblossom, who had since retired to work on charitable endeavours.

Shortly thereafter the servant returned with a wooden crate, branded on the bottom with the familiar eye and spiral insignia of House Dreamthistle and containing a dream lantern packed in straw. Asked if the party could keep the cursed artifact, Vallentin assured them that Dame Savindar had promised his full cooperation. The crate was resealed and loaded into Py's steel dragon for the journey back to the theater.

As they returned, the Silverstone Players found Cyrene pacing anxiously back and forth in front of the theater. She was promptly invited inside, where she apologized for not recogizing the eye-and-spiral symbol she had been asked to identify. Mo began to share what the party had learned about the dream lanterns, but when Cyrene heard they now had one such device in their possession, she was greatly alarmed - "You have a dream magic artifact, in the theater, right now?"

The astrologian immediately outside and cast a celestial messenger spell, conjuring a ball of light to which she spoke briefly in an unfamiliar tongue before it vanished into the air at great speed in the direction of the Celestial Observatory. A few minutes later, the celestial messenger returned, delivering to Cyrene a pouch of glowing dust she used to inscribe her mentor's sigil on the ground. The sigil complete, Ngozi appeared in a burst of starlight.

The Silverstone Players laid their cards on the table to the Sherem sorceress, sharing their knowledge of the Dream Lanterns, their insidious effects, and the connection to House Dreamthistle of the syndicate. Py removed their lantern from inside her construct, at which point Ngozi gave it a few careful nudges from her staff before a dizzying array of divination spells. Satisfied, Ngozi ordered the group to step back. The courtyard darkened and a ray of burning light descended from the sky, immolating the wooden crate and striking the lantern directly; as the focused starlight bounced around the mirrors inside the lantern, a horrifying silhouette of some writhing tentacled creature was revealed. With a final psychic scream, the creature perished, and the lantern shattered into a pile of broken bronze and silvered glass.

"An astral parasite", Ngozi proclaimed it, "set to infect the first person to open the lantern and to take root in their minds, generating terrible nightmares. The lantern, in turn, collects that oneiric energy and sends it...somewhere." Unfortunately, even she could not identify the precise nature of the parasitic entity, stating that in the deep astral, from is mutable and thought is paramount, making classification a fool's errand.

Worse, Ngozi warned the Silverstone Players that she cannot strike directly at the source of the lanterns - knowledge about the astral and its inhabitants creates a vulnerability to their influence. She could, however, assist the existing victims in exorcising the parasites from their minds, and agreed to work with Brother Lucian to do so. As for the source of the corruption, she tasked Cyrene with eliminating it, and asked the Silverstone Players to assist her apprentice in the task. To protect them, she incanted an *astral ward* over Cyrene and the party, granting their minds a temporary shield against the parasites and other mental influence, and healed them from the lingering effects of the dying parasite's psychic scream.

From there, a cure for the mysterious nightmares in sight, the party headed to Margritte's townhouse, where they were lead up to her sitting room. Magritte herself looked to be in terrible shape, wincing at footsteps and with heavy curtains blocking the light. The party explained what they had learned about the lantern's true nature, and told a relieved Margritte that a cure was now available. The socialite immediately called for her carriage to bring her and the Silverstone Players to the clinic, along with her lantern.

Patient and party alike were ushered into Brother Lucian's clinic by a waiting acolyte, where Ngozi was preparing a ritual circle. After delivering Margritte and her lantern, however, the party was summarily ejected from the clinic, as the procedure would be difficult enough without other nearby influences. The Silverstone Players waited some time for news, but after an hour an acolyte emerged with an apology and stated that it would take quite some time to safely remove the parasite from Margritte's mind.

The situation with Margitte resolved, the Silverstone Players began to debate whether to involve or warn the rest of the Harfoot Syndicate of House Dreamthistle's malfeasance. Mo and Py were in favor of coordinating a response with the syndicate, with Verity and Roya opposed. The group eventually agreed to gather more information before speaking with a representative of the Syndicate.

That afternoon, the Silverstone Players gathered their gear and equipment and headed to the Arcane Order, planning to shadow Ebard to his mysterious meeting. As the capable member of in matters of stealth, Roya was tasked with following Ebard, with the rest of the party waiting nearby in case of trouble.

Fortunately, the stakeout proceeded without complications. After emerging from his Remedial Conjuration class, Ebard spent several hours in the Pointed Cap before staggering out and heading for the meeting, still clutching his last Naiad's Dew. Due to his intoxicated state, he failed to notice Roya following as he took a circuitous route down into the Undercity, where he finally came to a sunken concourse of lost buildings and crumbling masonry.

A single halfling was waiting for Ebard there, although Roya spotted two more standing back outside of the circle of torchlight. She was contemptuous of Ebard, dismissing the broken magicite he had brought to sell as low quality trash. As Ebard slunk off back toward the upper districts, Roya chose to follow the halfling and her enforcers, calling on her innate wind magic to shroud her from sight. Her caution was rewarded as the group unwittingly led her to a large natural cavern, with what looked to be a warehouse or large workshop. The cavern was well lit and guarded, with both perimeter patrols and enforcers standing at the cavern entrances and in front of the warehouse.

Deciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Roya retreated back to the surface and shared what she had learned with the rest of the Silverstone Players. Accompanied by Cyrene, the party returned to the Undercity. Unfortunately, an ill-advised shortcut lead the group astray, finding themselves in a series of tunnels crudely carved from the stone; ahead, Roya and Verity spotted a hulking figure with mismatched ape and crab arms and a horrifying patchwork of fur and chitin, which roared a challenge to the intruders as it prepared to attack.

The Silverstone Players responded with a barrage of bolts, arrows, and magic. The malformed beast charged forward and nearly flattened Roya with its overside claw, who stabbed it deeply with her rapier and then retreated behind Py and her steel construct. Py in turn infused a crossbow bolt with radiant magic and fired it at the beast, striking the creature in the chest. Mo scorched the crab-ape with a series of fiery rays; enraged, the creature responded by pulling a boulder out of the wall with its hideous strength and throwing it wildly at the party. Another fusillade of arrows and magic struck the beast before Py finally brought it down with a crossbow bolt through an oversized compound eye.

Our heroes are thrilled at having overcome the chimeric horror, and slip back to the vicinity of the underground warehouse. As the structure comes into view, a problem comes into focus: the Silverstone Players have yet to decide how to accomplish their goal of shutting down the distribution of the lanterns. A direct assault seems likely to result in excessive noise and bloodshed, but sneaking the whole party in seems an unlikely prospect, and the guards are too closely packed to be picked off one by one. Ultimately, the group decides that Mo will scout ahead invisibly, while the rest will secure entrance through Verity’s magical charm.

With a bit of luck, Verity’s enchantment takes hold on the outermost pair of guards before they notice her approach. The guards are all too ready to provide information for their new friend, and Verity has many questions. Under her probing, a picture emerges of a deeply toxic workplace: those workers who step out of line are brought to the back room for discipline. When they emerge, they are no longer themselves, but Taken: as though something sinister, something alien, were now wearing their faces. The Dreamthistles–Jasper with his uncanny magic and Jasmine with her fancy sword–clearly run a tight shop, but the unvoiced suspicion among the staff is that they may not really be running things any more. Still, while these methods aren’t the epitome of harmonious labor relations, they appear surprisingly effective: this workshop has been making lanterns at a breakneck pace, and hundreds are ready to be shipped out shortly. The staff who have not been changed don’t dare drawing attention, and these guards are too terrified to leave their post.

Mo’s observations, meanwhile, complement this description perfectly: roughly a half-dozen anxious-looking guards are scattered near the warehouse door, while two thralls engage in steady mindless labor, moving boxes into position. Haphazard rows of components and boxed lanterns–along with the level of activity still being carried out at this late hour–suggest an operation whose considerable effectiveness arose less from efficiency than from the continuous application of increasingly frantic labor.

Back outside the warehouse, Verity’s interrogation has reached a dead end, so she decides to go with the old-fashioned approach: violence. She throws a blast of magic at her former friend, who shakes off his surprise to respond with a narrowly misdirected spear thrust, while his partner tosses an explosive device to alert the rest of the guards. Sensing an opportunity, Roya rushes up in an attempt to quickly subdue the second guard with a knockout strike; unfortunately, her adversary remains standing. Py’s wrench joins Verity’s blasts, and the spear-carrying guard is well and truly engaged.

Seeking a more dynamic battlefield, Roya works herself free of her opponent, charging toward the warehouse and then up its vertical walls, thanks to her climbing slippers. From her new elevated vantage point, she launches an arrow back toward the guard menacing Py and Verity, and brings him down, freeing Py up to charge two more of the guards responding to the alarm. Py’s wrench connects solidly with a guard who is then finished off by a barrage of Cyrene’s magic missiles.

Hearing the commotion outside, and seeing an unusually well-equipped and authoritative-looking adversary about to join the fray, Mo slips back outside in the shadow of the doorway and waits for a moment to engage.

Verity launches a series of eldritch blasts at the two guards engaged with Py, who goes on to have a rough few moments: Verity’s attack actually hits her, before she is sliced by a guard’s spear. Only a quick reflexive arcane shield keeps her from being further struck with the guard captain’s arrow: alas, Mo’s ambush came to naught when the guard captain shook off her attempted illusion. From up on the wall, Roya launches her own ambush, hitting the guard captain squarely with an arrow of her own. Py’s shield holds strong against the guards’ attacks, while Mo strikes the captain with arcane darts and Cyrene flings another barrage at the wounded guard. Feeling the heat too much, Roya retreats further up the roof, while Py’s steel defender deflects a guard’s spear, leaving him vulnerable to Mo’s precise bolt of fire. Py lands a wrench blow (while unfortunately singeing herself in the process). When Verity drops the final guard with another eldritch blast, the guard captain reads the room and yields.

The Silverspring Players are happy to be merciful if it brings the conflict to a faster end, and promise the guard captain she can go in exchange for information. The captain is all too happy to oblige–she’d been looking for a way out of her frankly abusive workplace, and has enough of her wits about her to know it’s time for a new career. Before she goes, she informs the party of what remains in the warehouse: Jasper and Jasmine and hundreds of lanterns. Any other guards have either been Taken or eaten, a fate the guard captain is pleased to avoid.

The party reflects on these sobering revelations, while Roya scouts around the roof. This proves to be uninformative: some covered-over skylights and boarded-up back windows are not likely to provide either egress or exit, so the party takes the captain at her word and moves in through the front door. The workers Mo saw earlier are huddled in the back with improvised clubs, but lack the initiative and spirit to represent any threat to the party. Indeed, they are too broken in spirit to do much of anything: despite a clearly quite effective raid, they are too afraid of their bosses to take the opportunity to escape.

Moving further into the warehouse, the Players discover a corridor with four side doors and one door at the back. The sounds of weeping leak through one closed door; two other rooms contain empty sleeping quarters and a storage room. The final room is a workshop–a quick investigation reveals a cache of magicite, which Mo claims for the party, though she unfortunately triggers a magical trap in the process. The sting is palpable, but it seems no one remains in the warehouse to respond to the alarm.

Resolved to press forward and complete their mission, the party opens the door at the end of the hallway.

The Silverstone Players are perhaps uniquely positioned to appreciate what lies beyond: well-acquainted with cheap theatrics, they recognize a throne room set when they see one. Two high-backed chairs, on a dais, stand on either side of one final doorway. Two halflings lounge in the chairs, unexpectedly calm, even bemused. The conversation that follows is full of rage from the party: they demand that the workers be released and the operation shut down, to which Jasmine replies that "The workers cannot leave, for the Master's touch is upon them. The Master is always with us."

Disgusted at this abuse of magic, Mo calls Jasper a cheap charlatan who should've stayed in school instead of using his power for evil. Jasper insults her studiousness, but then sighs, declaring that "You wouldn't understand. We didn't, until the Master showed us."

At this point, the Dreamthistles clearly refuse to back down, and the Players have had enough pointless conversation. Roya lunges at Jasmine with her rapier, then disengages and retreats; Py magically marks Jasper as her prey, but manages only a glancing blow with her crossbow. Verity tries to enchant Jasper, but it is ineffective: did he resist? Or is his mind already in the possession of another?

Perhaps out of a sense of honor between swashbucklers, Jasmine tries to duel Roya, while Jasper incants a word of madness that afflicts Roya, who responds by downing a potion of healing. Py's next crossbow bolt also goes wide. Mo manages to create a phantasmal cage in Jasmine's mind, trapping her; but Jasper responds by paralyzing Mo with a spell, and the invisible cage evaporates with Mo's lost concentration. Cyrene responds to Roya's injuries by healing her further; envigorated, Roya pierces Jasmine with her rapier, and Py's attack on Jasper strikes home. Under pressure, he gives up his enchantment of Mo to focus on making himself invisible. Verity, meanwhile, further controls the battlefield by filling Jasmine's mind with chaotic voices. Jasmine first flees to a corner of the office, before shaking it off and launching herself at Py; her attack is stopped by the valiant steel defender.

Things are clearly looking bad for the Dreamthistles, who try to escape: Jasper materializes next to Jasmine and tries to escape through a dimension door, but Mo counters the spell before it can complete. Roya prepares to use more conventional physical means to disrupt the next spell, while Mo strikes Jasmine down with a firebolt. Jasper is infuriated to see his sister swoon, and attempts to summon dark tentacles from another dimension, though Mo interrupts this spell as well. The Players rush forward, trying to take Jasper down too before he can escape, but he manages to cast a final dimension door and flee with his sister.

Exhausted by the fight, the Players nonetheless move quickly to study the operation. Verity searches the office and turns up a ledger listing all the existing customers of the dream lantern operation. Roya attempts to crack a safe, and discovers just in time that it is protected by a poisoned needle trap. She narrowly avoids the trap and the safe yields its secrets to her: coins and small gemstones worth 600 gold pieces, in various denominations. With nothing else of interest in the ersatz throne room, the party turn to remaining exit door; it is locked, but through the keyhole they spy dim lighting and a haze of foul-smelling mist.

Cyrene is eager to breach this final challenge to ensure that the entire operation has been expunged. But before pressing on, the party decides to tie up a few loose ends, and returns to the room with the sobbing voice. They enter to find an improvised cell, previously occupied by many a worker who has since been Taken, and currently occupied by one Reed Fastfoot. She is clearly distraught, as she was expecting to lose her identity completely within the next few hours. The Players' unfamiliar faces fill her with mistrust--but the tiniest glimmer of hope.

Reed asks the Players if they are from the Syndicate, finally attempting a rescue. The Players respond that while they aren't working under commission, rescue is at hand; Reed shakes like her namesake in relief. She tells the Players that she didn't see the final steps of the lanterns being made--whatever process infused them with their magical properties was not carried out in front of the workers--but she knew that something deeply wrong was being carried out here and finally reached a point where she could no longer be a part of it--"Making some gold is one thing, but whatever's going on here just isn't right"--only to discover that resigning from this operation is not actually an option. Reed, now freed, promises the party to use whatever authority she still has with the remaining workers to convince them to leave the premises, in the hope that they'll be more receptive to the message if it comes from a familiar face.

While Reed attempts her negotiations, the Players take a breather to prepare for whatever lies ahead in the room in back.

They open the door to discover a room which seems much larger than should be possible, given the external dimensions of the building, an effect only further enhanced by its far wall being hidden by a thick cloud of acrid, unnatural mist. The noxious fog fails to obscure the unsettling sight of what can only be described as a spawning pool of flesh, filled with squirming horrors. And before it all, staring down at the intruders, a creature with ink-black eyes and a face obscured by tentacles hovers expectantly: a mind flayer.

With the arrogance prized by his kind, the mind flayer informs the party that insects such as themselves should not presume to interfere with this operation--and that he will show them exactly how his inferiors ought to be dealt with, unleashing a tangible wave of psychic force at our heroes. Roya is stunned, and nearly killed, by the wave of mental malevolence; the others are struck soundly but not incapacitated. Recovering first from the surprise, Mo launches a firebolt at the aberration and strikes home. The creature deflects Py's crossbow quarrel into the wall with a telepathic pulse. Verity, fighting fire with fire, attempts to land a mental attack on the extradimensional egotist; unimpressed, the mind flayer enthralls Roya and commands her to draw Verity's blood. Py sends her steel defender to interpose between the two Players, but not before the rogue's attack hits true; meanwhile, the bard launches a pari of eldritch blasts at the eldritch beast, which loses its grip on Roya's mind. In retaliation, it launches another psychic blast, stunning Roya again and downing Verity entirely. Incensed at the deteriorating situation, Mo releases a barrage of fiery magic, nearly killing the mind flayer outright; but she is too spent to prevent the mind flayer from retreating through a rift into the deep dreaming.

The combat ended, the party tends to Verity and makes a quick examination of this alien space, finding nothing of interest (at least, not comprehensible to mortal minds). Cyrene meanwhile begins to assemble a spell circle with glowing magicite. Upon questioning, she says she will "cleanse the source of the corruption," and suggests that the others should clear the warehouse now, as they probably haven't been training their sprints as thoroughly as Cyrene has.

Understanding urgency when they see it, the party hastily herd the warehouse workers out, shortly joined by Cyrene, moving at a surprisingly rapid clip. Adventurers and refugees round a corner right before a brilliant blast promptly evaporates everything in the cavern. Exhausted, the party drops the workers--including two now-unresponsive thralls--off at Brother Lucian's clinic, then split up, with Cyrene returning to the Astral Observatory, and the others returning home, to reconvene the next day after a rest.

> Date: [23 Unicorn]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/adventures#autumn-2258)

As agreed, the Silverstone Players reconvene at the theater to discuss all that transpired the night before. Despite the rest, everyone is still rather shaken. But the Players have only begun to sort through their reactions when a carriage arrives, driven by a halfling in an uncommonly nice suit. Another, similarly-well-dressed, emerges and knocks on the door of the theater. Py answers (with her usual enthusiasm) but is merely handed an invitation addressed to The Silverstone Players, inviting them to dine with "a concerned citizen" at the Rabbit's Foot Casino that evening.

The party collectively discusses their concerns--both with the lanterns and the anonymous, but clearly Harfoot-involved, invitation--until Py and Roya decide to head to the cafe where they meet Marigold. Py explains the situation since their last meeting. When Marigold hears the party has received an invitation, she goes pale, stating that had she known, she would not have agreed to speak with Py. Marigold warns Py that the dress code at the casino is formal and that arms and armor are forbidden, and advises her to be honest but above all, respectful--one of these being a greater challenge than the other for most of the Players. Not wanting to leave anything to casual assumption, Roya asks who the invitation is from, and Marigold responds that only one person issues such an invitation: the founder of all the Houses and the Syndicate itself.

Py and Verity, less sartorially endowed by nature than Mo and Roya, find formal attire, then the party heads to the dinner.

Upon arrival, they are led by silent foothalfings in livery through a series of lavishly decorated hallways, past the elegant patrons in the well-appointed public rooms, to a private dining hall with a long table, a large fire, and a diminutive but perfectly self-prepossessed halfling already seated at one end. He looks them over with a piercing glance, and gesturing to the table, invites them to "sit, eat." The Players thank him for the food--a delicious multi-course meal with exquisite wine pairings indulged in by three of the four.

At the conclusion of the meal, the founder compliments the party on their refinement in not spoiling a meal with talk of business, then begins his own business discussion. Specifically, the Syndicate cannot tolerate anyone openly opposing any of its Houses without consequence. At the Players' urging, he does acknowledge that they have in fact done him a favor, in one sense: the business in which late House Dreamthistle had been engaged was certain to bring unwarranted attention from every power structure in the city--indeed, was already doing so--which would have led to outside involvement which even the Syndicate could not easily control. Nevertheless, Syndicate matters are to be handled within the Syndicate alone.

The Players suggest a potential resolution: that it be made known that they were acting on his orders, with his prior knowledge, and thus not outsiders for this particular matter, while also not a rival House whose involvement could spark an ongoing internecine conflict. The Founder suggests that the Players in fact come to work for him in earnest, to keep an eye on his Houses and maintain their balance, while perhaps accomplishing the occasional additional task. He expresses also the temptation of "some personal pleasure in stealing away my old colleague's proteges." The Players state that regretfully a long-term association will not be possible, to which he instead says that they will owe him a debt for agreeing to the ruse--and that they will one day perform a service for him, whereupon they are gently escorted out of the casino. But not before asking one final question--the identity of their benefactor-patron, who reveals himself to be none other than Ulmo Appleblossom, Halfling Rogue of the Four Immortals.

As they make their way back to the Theater, the Players have a tense discussion among themselves about the implications of their debt to the Syndicate and just what will happen next.
