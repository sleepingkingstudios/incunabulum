Half a tenday has passed since the conclusion of the Dream Lanterns, but the Silverstone Players have little time to rest, having accepted a commission through the Delver's Guild to escort a giantish client beneath the city to the Gallery of Ruined Gates. As they begin the trip to the guild headquarters, they discuss what they know about giants - that the giants built a vast civilization thousands of years in the past, powered by runic magic and connected by magical gates that connected far-flung places and even other planes of existence. However, after long wars with the dwarves, the giantist empire was destroyed, leaving small communities here and there in mostly inhospitable places, such as the mountains surrounding Wellspring.

On arrival at the Delver's Guild, the Silverstone Players were met by Mialee Sylvaranth, who shared with them a new complication. While another delving party (the Company of the Black Lanterns) had finally charted a new path to the Gallery of Ruined Gates, the route was unexpectedly treacherous, leading through areas far more dangerous than expected. Although the client was willing to continue, she did not have the funds for a delve of that level of risk; however, if the party was still willing to meet with her, she was able to offer alternative compensation.

The Silverstone Players debated among themselves; first, whether they were comfortable continuing the task considering the unexpected level of danger. Fresh off their victory against House Dreamthistle, they concluded that although their delving experience was relatively thin, they had more than proved their mettle in other areas. With that resolved, the Silverstone Players agreed to meet with the client and discuss the alternative compensation.

The party was lead upstairs to a conference room where they were introduced to Dagmar Ragnasdottir, a storm giant with blue-green skin and hair the color of thunderclouds. She explained that she was a rune carver from the Choir of Shaped Stone, and wished to study the craft of her ancient ancestors to perhaps someday replicate their feats of magic. In exchange for the party's assistance, she offered to perform for them a ritual to grant the blessing of the Ordnung, the giantish pantheon. Mo's study of rare arcana proved useful; although she knew little about giantish religion, she recalled that giantish rune magic was capable of powerful and long-lasting effects, and could be a long-term boon to the party. Convinced, the Silverstone Players agreed to continue with the contract.

With that settled, Mialee returned to brief the party on what to expect beneath the city. Since Dagmar's commission is the group's first official delve, she began with a lecture on the guild's trail signs, used to navigate underground once another group of adventurers had discovered a path. She also warned that defacing trail signs would be dealt with most harshly.

Once underground, the party should follow the delvers' signs to a series of landmarks: through the Weeping Shrine, up the Inverted Stair, and finally to the Fungal Forest in the middle Deeps. From there, the Silverstone Players would have to enlist the aid (or at least the permission) of the local myconids, friendly but territorial mushroom folk. She warned that first-time visitors to myconid caverns were often given a task to serve the community before they were accepted into the territory of the mushroom folk. Finally, a myconid guide would lead the group across the Starlit Mirror, and then back up through the caves to reach the Gallery.

Once Dagmar and the Silverstone Players were ready to depart, Mialee lead them to an oddly fortified outbuilding on the grounds of the Last Stop, with reinforced walls and a door heavily barred from the outside. Cautiously opened, it revealed a staircase spiraling down beneath Wellspring. Py quickly doused a small stone in a glowing reagent for light, and the group started their descent.

The path was long and winding; several times they could swear they were wandering in circles, but followed the trail signs faithfully until they began to see what looks like sunlight up ahead. As they approached, Verity's keen ears picked up the sound of a group of creatures arguing in the Draconic tongue. She sneaks closer, hearing the voices argue about going higher or lower, but trips over a rock and alerts the still unseen speakers. Trying to be helpful, Py uses a toy construct to create the sound of birds, confusing things further.

Verity carefully continues, approaching what can only be the Weeping Shrine - a chapel of sorts with rows of stone pews and great windows of stained glass, shining with impossible sunlight, and a hulking stone statue of some weeping figure at it's heart. Hiding among the pews were a half-dozen kobolds with mottled brown-green scales, raising spear and shield in a defensive formation.

With the kobolds not immediately hostile, Verity announced herself in the Draconic tongue, and a cautious truce was obtained: "Friends not fight dragonkin, dragonkin not fight friends." As the rest of the Silverstone Players approached, Verity spoke with the kobolds, who turned out to be lost and trying to return to their "nest", somewhere below. Based on their description, the party surmised the kobolds had also stumbled across the Inverted Stair, and offered to show the dragon-kin the secret of its navigation. In gratitude, their leader named themself as Fernscale, and offered their friendship henceforth.

While Verity spoke with the kobolds, the rest of the Silverstone Players took the opportunity to look around the Weeping Shrine. Py examined the statue at the shrine's heart, worked roughly from a single piece of mottled white-grey stone into the shape of a humanoid holding its head in its hands. Despite its size, the statue lacked details to identify its subject. There were traces of some red liquid drying on its stone cheeks.

Mo in turn looked at the impossibly lit stained glass windows lining the shrine. While most seemed to hold abstract shapes, a few formed recognizable symbols, including a pair of scales, an opened eye, and six circles in an array of colors from white to red-veined black, and mottled blue-green to a poisonous yellow.

Though intriguing, the imagery seemed to hold little relevance to their task, and the Silverstone Players, one giant, and a half-dozen kobolds continued onward.

The next landmark reached by the Silverstone Players and company was the Inverted Stair. As the name promised, it was a spiraling staircase of finely carved stone and immense length, turned upside down as if in some great cataclysm. In addition to the inherently treacherous footing (the underside of stairs not, generally speaking, being meant for traversal), the entire edifice stood tilted ten degrees off of vertical, and lay crumbling in sections, creating a hazard of loose stones and falling masonry. Strangest of all, to descend the Inverted Stair to the middle Deeps below Wellspring, the Silverstone Players had to *climb* a grueling distance, while returning closer to the surface required a descent.

The Silverstone Players and giant dealt with this task with varying degrees of equanimity, from Roya taking a casual walk along the walls using her magical slippers to Py fashioning ramps and pulleys to lift her steel defender across gaps. Fortunately, the treacherous footing of Dagmar's mountain home put her in good stead to navigate the stairs, while only the quick application of a spell of feather falling saved Mo from a dangerous plunge.

The party followed the guild trail signs to a tunnel into the middle Deeps. Here they parted ways with the kobolds, who once again professed their friendship before continuing their journey up and deeper beneath the city.

From the Inverted Stairs, the Silverstone Players escorted Dagmar farther into the Deeps below Wellspring, following the trail signs left by their fellow delvers. Gradually the air became more humid, bringing with it a lingering scent of rot and decay. Small mushrooms began to be seen growing in nooks and crevices, or glowing a fickle blue-purple radiance on the ceiling. At last, the party emerged into a much larger cavern filled with giant mushrooms of all shapes and colors; before they could continue on, a pair of myconids erupted from the soil in front of them and leveled wooden staves, calling on the intruders to halt.

The Silverstone Players quickly explained that they were from the Delver's Guild. Still suspicious, the myconids demanded that the party perform a service for them in exchange for passage and a guide through their territory - a cruel fire elemental had taken up residence in one of their farms, and the Silverstone Players were tasked with banishing or destroying it.

After a brief discussion, they agreed to take on the task. One of the myconid guards, who identified themself as Hydnum, lead the party on a winding route through the mushroom-overgrown caverns, including one memorable passage across an arched stone bridge over a deep chasm, rushing water visible far below. Finally, they were led to a terraced cave with many burned mushrooms and a lingering scent of sulfur and smoke.

Both the myconid guard and Dagmar remained behind, while the Silverstone Players advanced with caution into the burned cavern. That caution was shortly rewarded as a trio of fire snakes emerged from the ground in attempted ambush, scorching Verity and striking Mo with both fang and burning tail. Py retaliated with her wrench only to discover that physically striking the fire snakes sent a shower of fiery shards to scorch anyone nearby. Mo cast a spell to slow the elementals, while Verity struck them with bolts of magic.

It was in that moment that the larger elemental attacked, a fearsome salamander wielding a spear of burning hot bronze. The salamander threw its spear at Roya and nearly entangled her in its coils. Py and Mo each strike down one of the smaller elementals, while Verity targeted the salamander with a spell of shattering, deeply damaging the larger elemental's stony flesh. In retaliation, it hit Verity with both spear and tail, bringing the bard down. Py rushed forward with a scroll of healing, reviving Verity, while Mo destroyed the last smaller elemental with a barrage of magic missiles.

Enraged, Verity cast a second spell of shattering with her full magical power, while Mo used her divination to disrupt another series of attacks. Py splashed the salamander with alchemical acid, and together with another magical barrage and a final shatter spell brought the elemental down for good. Py claimed the salamander's spear as a trophy.

The Silverstone Players returned to Dagmar and the myconid guard, somewhat unsteadily, and reported that their task was complete. In gratitude, the myconid granted the party the friendship of his people, marking them permanently with spores to indicate their allied status to any other of the mushroom folk. Battered and wearied, the Silverstone Players asked and received permission to camp in the burned cavern and recover.

The following morning, the Silverstone Players were met by another myconid, a guard named Agaricus who announced they would guide the party through the rest of myconid territory. After another winding journey through the mushroom-overgrown caverns, they came to the shores of an enormous underground lake - the Starlit Mirror, named for the glimmering mushrooms on the ceiling whose light reflected in the still waters, resembling the stars in the sky. Agaricus lead the party to a shadowy jetty on the water's edge, where they ushered the group onto a raft, somewhat cramped by the giant. They then summoned a pair of tortles from the lake, who guided the raft across the water to another jetty on the far side, marked by a glowing lantern.

This was the edge of the Myconid territory, and the Silverstone Players would have to rely on the guild trail signs once again to find their destination. Agaricus told the party to wave the lantern when they were ready to make the return journey. Leaving the mushroom-folk guard behind, the party ascended a winding switchback path to a ledge high over the lake, and found the trail signs that marked the way forward.

After an arduous journey through the Deeps, the Silverstone Players and Dagmar finally reach the Gallery of Ruined Gates. The Gallery was one of the largest and best-known landmarks beneath Wellspring, a larged domed chamber over two hundred feet in diameter, shaped from solid stone and lined with elaborately carved masonry. Around the circumference of the gallery, dozens of runic gates lay in various states of decay and ruin, from broken stone circles to piles of rubble. Close to center of the chamber, four more gates stood nearly intact, some with energy still flickering fitfully in their carvings.

Dagmar was deeply excited to reach their destination at last, and began to examine the ruins around the edges of the gallery. As she worked, the Silverstone Players asked her some questions about the gates. Dagmar explained that the runic gates each created a two-way connection to their twin, whether in a far-distant place or even on another plane of existence. The gallery, then, served as a travel nexus, likely powered by the confluence of "dragon veins" (Mo helpfully translated to "ley lines") beneath Wellspring. The shattered outer gates connected to other locations on the same plane, although they were too damaged to identify their destinations. Dagmar dutifully copied down the few intact runes she could find, then moved on to the four standing intact in the center.

The central gates were slightly larger and visibly more complicated, free-standing stone circles heavily carved with runes. These, Dagmar determined, were likely built to connect to destinations on other planes of existence. The giant examined the outermost gate first, visibly crumbling in places, and determined that it had once linked to the Shadowfell, a realm of twilight, spirits, and the dead. Perhaps fortunately, this gate was too damaged, as if artificially aged or decayed. Mo attempted to use a knowledge ritual to interpret the ancient giantish runes still visible on the gate, but lacked the cultural context.

The second gate lead to the Feywild, a realm of nature and the fae; specifically, it lead to a domain called Prismeer. The gate seemed to be very nearly intact. Dagmar took out some of her stoneworking tools and began touching up the damaged runes. To her astonishment, the gate seemed to still be partially activated but improperly closed, with someone seeming trapped in limbo. Before the Silverstone Players could voice their alarm, she repaired the last runes and the Feywild gate activated for an instant, expelling a tiny winged form.

With Mo's translation ritual still active, she was able to understand the pixie as she shook herself off and took flight, talking in rapid-fire Sylvan.

- To the bemused Dagmar, the pixie said "Hello! You're big! Hello!".
- Mo attempted to communicate with the fairy using a message spell, but the arcane magic only gave the pixie a headache. She then flew over to Mo and announced "You smell like the sea. But also icky magic."
- To Py, the pixie said "You smell like us? But also iron. You are strange!" She carefully avoided the artificer's steel defender.
- To Roya, the pixie said "Hello cousin! You smell like a spring breeze!"
- Finally, she flew over to Verity. "Hello! You smell familiar! Like the mortal boy I played hide and seek with! He hid in the portal."

Verity immediately suspected a connection to the disappearance of her brother Honor years before. She sketched a quick picture of her brother for the excitable pixie, who confirmed that was the "mortal boy" she used to play with. Still unable to communicate back to the pixie, Py tries some simple words in Elvish; the fairy only seemed to recognize the word for food, but accepted a sugary offering from the artificer and then alighted on her head.

Meanwhile, Dagmar continued to look at the Feywild portal before finally giving up - to the best of her knowledge, it looked as if the gate had been sealed from the other side.

Dagmar continued on to examine the gate to the celestial realms. Unfortunately, this gate had been deliberately sabotaged by someone on this side, many of the runes stricken through seemingly at random. The final portal, in contrast, was merely damaged. Determined to learn what she could, Dagmar pulled a number of curious supplies from her oversized pack - a set of mithril chisels, a handful of everburning coals, and a bottle full of storm clouds among others - and began the work of repairing the damaged section of the gate. As she worked, Dagmar mentioned off-hand that the gate's destination seemed to be labelled as "Demiurge", a location in the infernal planes.

Without warning, the giantish gate activated, showing a glimpse of a blasted hellscape before the view was obscured by a cloud of sulfurous smoke, in which four hulking canine forms began stalking toward the Silverstone Players. Caught by surprise, Mo suffered a vicious mauling from two of the hell hounds before using a short-range teleportation to hide behind Py and her construct. The other two demons attacked Roya, relying on pack tactics to keep her off balance. Mo retaliated with a fireball, which the infernal creatures seemed unaffected by, while Verity launched a psychic attack, causing her target to flee into the rubble around the edge of the gallery.

Roya wounded one of the hell hounds attacking her and then fled atop one of the gates, while Py injured another with her crossbow. With their prey in flight, one of the beasts tried to pursue Mo and was blocked by Py's construct, while two others switched targets to Verity and mauled the bard. Mo managed to strike all three visible hell hounds with a curse of slowing, allowing Verity to retreat and cast on herself a spell of recovery. Py launched a flurry of blows with her weighted wrench, allowing Roya to leap down atop it with her rapier and dagger. Assisted by a timely portent from Mo, they managed to bring one of the hell hounds down.

Two of the infernal creatures leapt at Py in retaliation, only foiled by a hasty arcane shield. It was then that the pixie, still sitting on Py's head, shouted a warning "Hey, listen!" and limned the last hell hound in faerie fire, revealing it about to pounce on Mo from behind. The diviner launched a barrage of arcane bolts at it, aided by another psychic attack by Verity. Py and Roya again teamed up to strike one of their foes with wrench and sword, deeply wounding it. With one of their number dead and the rest injured, the hell hounds gave a last howl of hatred before fleeing down one of the tunnels.

The Silverstone Players took the opportunity to lick their proverbial wounds. To their alarm, the gate to Demiurge opened a second time before dramatically burning out; through the portal stepped a woman of unmistakable demonic heritage, with curved horns and black wings, and wearing a very stylish suit and spectacles. Eyebrow raised, she asked who in the group had been playing around with the portals, and introduced herself as the "Herald of Akasha, mistress of Demiurge." She stated that the ability to craft gates was of considerable interest to her mistress, and she had been empowered to offer the crafter responsible an opportunity to study under Akasha herself. With Dagmar showing uncharacteristic good sense and remaining silent, the Silverstone Players collectively declined her offer, at which the fiend created a free-standing planar portal of her own accord and stepped through.

The excitement temporarily over, Dagmar took another look at the damaged infernal portal, and determined she could still repair it, but she would require some rare materials and assistance both from a modern arcane crafter as well as some stonesingers from her community.

<!-- Session Break -->

Verity belatedly remembered that her bardic talents granted a limited ability to speak with the pixie. Unfortunately, the excitable fey had little more to share with her regarding her brother's disappearance. The pixie did not know how long had elapsed since Honor entered the portal, only that Honor had been playing "hide and seek"; inferring from context, her brother had been searching for something.

The pixie could share some information about the portal's destination - it lead to the realm of Prismeer, a domain ruled by the archfey Zyblina. Neither name was familiar to the Silverstone Players, but Mo recalled that other planes can have localized pockets or domains, often ruled by a powerful entity and with their own properties and rules. The library at the Arcane Order might have more information; Mo also remembers mention of a group of "amateurs" calling themselves the Society of Planar Cartographers, who have a clubhouse of sorts in the Upper City.

Py takes a wild guess and asks the pixie about the Witchlight Carnival; surprisingly, the name is familiar to the pixie, who recalls the carnival visiting Prismeer and being gifted a boon by the mistress of that domain. Unfortunately, the pixie has no way to return to the fey realms on her own, let alone with the Silverstone Players in tow. She did agree to help them find Honor if they managed to make it to the Feywild, since she never did get to finish their game of hide and seek.

Wounded and low on magic, the Silverstone Players felt too exposed in the gallery, especially with the surviving hell hounds on the loose somewhere in the tunnels. With Dagmar in tow and a pixie firmly settled atop Py's head, they returned to the shores of the Starlight Mirror. As promised, after waving the lantern a raft arrived to bear them back across to myconid territory, where they were invited to a "feast" in the mushroom folks' village.

The village was built into the sides of a rift in the earth, crossed by rickety stone bridges and dotted with hanging lanterns of glowing fungus; deep below, water collected in a stagnant pool. Verity remained inwardly focused during the celebration, occasionally writing in her journal, while Mo snuck off to eat some rations in peace.

Feeling more adventurous, Py wandered off and found a spiritual figure of some sort among the myconids, who offered her an edible shroom to "help her understand the fungal perspective". Consuming it before she could have second thoughts, Py was launched into a vivid vision of five colored orbs spinning around in a conceptual space, representing the world and the four moons. Strangely, one seemingly empty space in the vision was inexplicably terrifying to Py, as if her mind simply could not acknowledge whatever was there. Fortunately, Roya followed and ensured the pixie remained entertained while Py went on her spiritual journey.

The following morning, the Silverstone Players and escorted giant returned to the surface and the Delver's Guild. Dagmar bid the group return that evening to receive their rewards, a runic tattoo holding a blessing from one of the giantish deities.

Py and Mo planned to visit the library of the Arcane Order together, and seek more information on the Feywild, the domain of Prismeer, and its mistress Zyblina. Verity and Roya would seek the same at the Society of Planar Cartographers. And, of course, in a tenday's time the party would need to depart Wellspring and head back to the Bronzewood to attend the Witchlight Carnival...
