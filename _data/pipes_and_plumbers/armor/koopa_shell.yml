  At the start of your turn, you may choose to wield the Koopa Shell as a
  weapon. Until the start of your next turn, you lose the Defense bonus (and
  any other benefits of the armor), but you can attack enemies as if you have a
  Koopa Shell weapon equipped (in addition to any weapon you normally have
  equipped).
