The region is dominated by the City of Wellspring, located in a small natural valley high in the mountains, with the Great Chasm at its heart. To the northeast is the Vale, a great valley sloping down from the city to the distant foothills.

## [The City Of Wellspring]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/city-of-wellspring)

The City of Wellspring is laid out in six districts; three in [the Upper City](#the-upper-city), three in [the Lower City](#the-lower-city). Beneath the city proper is [the Undercity](#the-undercity), a tangled warren of slums, sewers, and ruins beyond the reach of the law.

### [The Upper City]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/city-of-wellspring#the-upper-city)

The highest part of the city is referred to as the Upper City, where the rich, powerful, and influential of Wellspring live, work, and play.

### [The Lower City]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/city-of-wellspring#the-lower-city)

The districts known as the Lower City is where most of the people of Wellspring live and work.

### [The Undercity]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/city-of-wellspring#the-undercity)

The area beneath the city proper is known as the Undercity. Officially, this area lies beyond the city's protection, and the City Guard are rarely seen here unless pursuing a fugitive.

## The Great Chasm

The Great Chasm is both the reason for the City of Wellspring’s existence and its single greatest threat. A vast rift in the earth of unknown depth, the Great Chasm is a powerful source of natural magic. As such, it draws creatures and monsters of all descriptions, some of which are drawn to the city above (or driven there by even more terrifying beasts from the depths).

In particular, the mana from the Chasm ebbs and flows, and can rarely and unexpectedly surge, driving hostile creatures up into the city in great numbers. These events are referred to as Upwellings. At least twice in the city’s past, a Great Upwelling has seen fighting as far as in the Upper City, but even the “average” outbreak is dangerous and can cause significant damage to the lower districts.

## [Beneath Wellspring]({{site.baseurl}}/campaigns/wellspring/setting/geography/beneath-wellspring)

Beneath the city of Wellspring lies a vast, mostly uncharted network of caves, caverns, and catacombs, home to creatures fair and foul and filled with lairs, traps, treasures, and ruins from lost and ancient civilizations. Collectively, they are known as the Deeps. Members of the Delvers' Guild risk their lives to explore the Deeps in search of fame, fortune, and the all-important magicite that crystallizes from raw mana from the Great Chasm.

## Around Wellspring

- [The Bronzewood](#the-bronzewood)
- [The Giant's Spine Mountains](#the-giants-spine-mountains)
- [Shadepool](#shadepool)
- [Wellspring Value](#wellspring-value)

### The Bronzewood

A narrow valley leading off from Wellspring Value, filled with old-growth woods. The forest for a day's travel was ceded to the Kingdom of Lothian by treaty, and are traveled by hunters, trappers, and woodcutters who search for rare and magical trees and plants. A fair number of halfling communities also lie in the Bronzewood, closer to nature than their city cousins. The areas beyond the Treaty Stones are guarded by elvish arrows and home to druidic circles, strange beasts, and pathways to the fey realms.

### The Giant's Spine Mountains

Wellspring lies near the heart of the Giant’s Spine Mountains. The lower peaks are craggy, with thick stands of evergreens but rocky soil and unpredictable frosts. Higher peaks are snowcapped year round. Several trails lead away from the city deeper into the mountains, too narrow and treacherous to be proper passes, but navigable by the sufficiently determined.

Several communities of giants are known to live in the nearby mountains, with one - the Moot of Mooncarven Stone - known to have close ties with the Watchers of the Stars. Below the northern peaks lies the Dwarvish city of Silverhold, connected to the city itself by the Underroad.

### Shadepool

A village of halflings, mostly gnomes (earth bloodline) and undines (water bloodline). The village is built around a large earthen dam, the reservoir of which provides a comfortable home for the water-breathing residents.

Shadepool is located about a day's travel into the Bronzewood, or two full day's travel from Wellspring.

### Wellspring Vale

The Vale is a long valley, gently rising from the foothills to the edge of Wellspring itself, nestled between the peaks. Since the founding of the city is has become densely settled, with forests largely converted to managed timber and the slopes terraced with farmland and vinyards. The once-wild Lion river that courses down the valley’s heart is now tamed to feed irrigation and feed the hundreds of locks that carry trade up and down the canal.

## The Wider World

Wellspring is part of the [Kingdom of Lothian](#the-kingdom-of-lothian). To the east are the [Giant’s Spine Mountains](#the-giants-spine-mountains). To the north is the [Sherem Magocracy](#the-sherem-magocracy). To the west is the Sea of Emeralds and the [Free Cities](#the-free-cities). To the south is the [Patchwork Kingdoms](#the-patchwork-kingdoms), a frequently-shifting collection of smaller polities.

### The Free Cities

A collection of independent city-states surrounding the Sea of Emeralds to the west of Lothian. Each of the Free Cities is fiercely independent, and squabbling or outright warfare between them is common, typically conducted by hired mercenaries.

### The Kingdom of Lothian

The land now comprising the Kingdom of Lothian was a lightly settled backwater beset by banditry and monster attacks. An informal cabal of robbers and cutthroats banded together in an attempt to monopolize trade along the Southern Caravan Road, making outrageous demands in the process to the small towns and freeholders of the Lion river valley.

In response, the locals organized together, forging simple weapons in secret and drilling town militias under cover of darkness. Their informal leader was a blacksmith named Arielle, whose forge had been burned down by a bandit lord when she refused to craft him a sword. Over the course of a twenty year campaign, the bandits hold was weakened and finally broken. The people acclaimed Queen Arielle the Lion-hearted as the ruler of a new nation, ruling from a captured keep overlooking the river ford.

The city of Lion’s Ford is still the heart of Lothian, although the river had been bridged and the ford itself dredged to allow barge traffic upriver to Wellspring Vale. The kingdom is currently jointly ruled by King Durant and Queen Margot, who are siblings and descendants of Arielle the Lion-hearted. Each has several children by their respective consorts, and while the arrangement is stable for now some worry about a crisis of succession in the future.

To the east, the threat of a tide of monsters boiling down Wellspring Vale has been pacified by the foundation of Wellspring itself. To the north, the neighboring Sherem Magocracy remains Lothian’s primary threat, with several wars fought over the magical potential of the Great Chasm. To the south lies the Patchwork Kingdoms, an endless source of banditry and border raids, as well as considerable wealth carried along the Southern Caravan Road. To the west are the Free Cities, which trade up and down the Lion river and carry cargoes from the distant south around the borders of the reclusive Sherem.

### The Patchwork Kingdoms

South of the Kingdom of Lothian are the Patchwork Kingdoms, an ever-shifting frontier of disputed claims and brush wars. Much of the territory is uninhabited badlands or wild frontier, of importance only due to the South Caravan Road which carries exotic luxuries to Lothian, Sherem and the Free Cities.

#### Dragon's Fall

The newest nation in the Patchwork Kingdoms styles itself Dragon’s Fall. Formerly a minor principality in the foothills of the Giant’s Spine Mountains, it was reknowned for the quality of its wines and the competence of its pike guards. Unfortunately, the discovery of precious metals in the mines drew the attention of an ancient dragon, Razzavinax the Red. He burned the vineyards, slaughtered the guards, and installed himself as tyrant of the vale. A mercenary company out of the Free Cities fought and slew Razzavinax, restyling themselves the Dragonslayers and forging powerful weapons and armor from the dragon’s remains. The mercenaries now rule Dragon’s Fall as a private fiefdom.

#### The Queendom of Palmyra

The southern terminus of the caravan road is the Queendom of Palmyra, said to contain wealth beyond imagination. Virtually all trade between Lothian, Sherem, and places farther north to the rest of the world passes via caravan to or from Palmyra, to be exchanged for exotic luxuries from lands far across the sea.

## Across The Seas

Somewhere in the vast ocean are the Elven Isles, the homeland of the shoal elves, where few outsiders are ever permitted landfall. Elvish caravels are said to sail every sea in the world, and are of the very few who dare the storms, dragon turtles and uncharted passages beyond the mouth of the Sea of Emeralds to reach the open ocean. All other trade from the southern ports must travel by caravan.

Far beyond the seas, other lands are known to exist. One continent is said to be ruled by halflings, who trade cargoes of tea and cotton in the southern ports. Those traders speak of lands still more distant, where silk and spices flow like water and strange wonders are built of enchanted jade. Other sailors speak of a land ruled by giants, who returned and fought a terrible war against a race of wicked dragons, and of people mixed with wolves and lions and creatures stranger still.
