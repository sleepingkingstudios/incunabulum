### Attack Check

A [check](#check) made to determine the success or failure of a weapon attack. Unless otherwise specified, an attack check uses the creature or character's Power bonus, and the difficulty of the check is the target's Defense score.

If the check succeeds by 3 or more (e.g. a result of 13 or higher on a Difficulty of 10), the attack is a [critical hit](#critical-hit), inflicting double damage. Otherwise, on a passing result the attack succeeds and deals normal damage. On a failing result, the attack misses and does not inflict any damage.

### Attribute

A numerical measure of a [creature](#creature) or [character](#character)'s abilities. For each attribute, each character defines an **attribute bonus** and an **attribute score**.

Pipes and Plumbers defines the following attributes:

- **Power:** Used for making weapon attacks.
- **Defense:** Used for resisting weapon attacks.
- **Magic:** Used for making special attacks.
- **Speed:** Used for determining turn order, and resisting most special attacks.

#### Attribute Bonus

A modifier used to make Attribute checks. Typically a number between +1 and +6.

#### Attribute Score

A static value used as a check difficulty when making checks against the character. The attribute score is determined by adding 7 to the attribute bonus. For example, when attacked with a special ability that targets Defense, the difficulty of the check is the character's Defense score.

### Attribute Check

An attribute check uses the specified Attribute bonus as the check bonus for performing the action. For example, when making a Speed check, the check bonus is the character's Speed attribute bonus.
