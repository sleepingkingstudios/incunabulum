## Running The Game

### Basic Mechanics

#### The Check

The basic task resolution mechanism in *Pipes and Plumbers* is the **check**.

A check is used to determine the success or failure of something a character tries to do. If the check succeeds, then the character succeeds at the attempted action; if the check fails, then the action fails. Not every action requires a check: an action that is trivially easy should always succeed, while an action that is impossibly difficult will never succeed no matter how well the dice cooperate. Likewise, only an action that has meaningful consequences for success or failure should require a check. Running across a rain-slick castle roof will require a Speed check, while walking across the courtyard should not.

To perform a check, do the following steps:

1. Roll two six-sided dice (or 2d6) and add the values together. The result of the dice is called the **roll**.
2. Add to that the check **bonus**, which is usually determined by one of the creature or character's calculated values. Sometimes the bonus may be zero or even negative.
3. The sum of the **roll** and the **bonus** is the **check result**.
4. Finally, compare the **check result** to the **difficulty**. If the result is greater than or equal to the difficulty, then the check is a **success**. If the result was less than the difficulty, then the check is a **failure**.

The game defines a shorthand in the form of a *"value"* check for checks that use a specified calculated value as the check **bonus**. For example, a Magic check uses the character's Magic value as the check bonus.

> **Example**
>
> While exploring the basement of Bowser's Keep, the party discovers a puzzle of arcane knowledge. Solving the puzzle requires a successful Magic check with a difficulty of 12. As the character with the highest magic, Donatello attempts to solve the puzzle and rolls two six-sided dice, getting a 3 and a 5 for a **roll** of 8. He also adds the **bonus**, which is his Magic value of 5. The **check result** is 13, which is greater than or equal to the **difficulty** of 12, so the check is a success. A hidden panel slides open, revealing the lost Wand of Kamek.

> **Example**
>
> The party is being chased through the sewers by a giant Goomba. Leonardo spots a lever that will close the sewer grate behind them, but the lever is rusty and stuck. The Narrator decides that this is a Power check with a difficulty of 10. Leonardo rolls two six-sided dice and gets a 2 and a 3, for a **roll** of 5. He also adds the **bonus**, which is his Power value of 4. The **check result** is 9, less than the **difficulty** of 10, so the check is a failure. He heaves heroically at the lever, but it refuses to budge as the giant Goomba barrels into the room...

Some types of checks may have additional mechanics. For example, when an [attack check](#attack-checks) succeeds by 3 or more, then the attack is a critical hit and inflicts additional damage.

#### Making Checks As A Group

Determining who in a party can or needs to perform a check can be difficult. Here are some suggestions on how to adjudicate different situations.

- **Everyone Rolls:** Use this rule when the effect of a success or failure is independent for each character. For example, a falling rocks trap would require a separate Defense check for each party member caught in the area.
- **Lowest Bonus Rolls:** Use this rule when any character failing the check would cause the entire party to fail. The classic example for this rule would be sneaking past a set of guards; determine which character has the lowest Speed value, and have that character roll for the entire group.
- **Highest Bonus Rolls:** Use this rule when any character succeeding at the check would cause the entire party to succeed. In the example above with the magical puzzle, Donatello makes the check for the party because he has the highest Magic value.

#### Assisting Other Characters

Whether or not other characters can assist in a check is left to the Narrator's discretion. As a general rule, each additional helper adds +1 to the check result. Thus, if Michaelangelo or Rafael had stayed to help Leonardo pull the rusty lever, their combined efforts would (just barely) have succeeded in time.
