## Running The Game

### Basic Mechanics

#### The Check

The basic task resolution mechanism in *Pipes and Plumbers* is the **check**.

A check is used to determine the success or failure of something a character tries to do. If the check succeeds, then the character succeeds at the attempted action; if the check fails, then the action fails. Not every action requires a check: an action that is trivially easy should always succeed, while an action that is impossibly difficult will never succeed no matter how well the dice cooperate. Likewise, only an action that has meaningful consequences for success or failure should require a check. Running across a rain-slick castle roof will require a Speed check, while walking across the courtyard should not.

To perform a check, do the following steps:

1. Roll two six-sided dice (or 2d6) and add the values together. The result of the dice is called the **roll**.
2. Add to that the check **bonus**, which is usually determined by one of the creature or character's calculated values. Sometimes the bonus may be zero or even negative.
3. The sum of the **roll** and the **bonus** is the **check result**.
4. Finally, compare the **check result** to the **difficulty**. If the result is greater than or equal to the difficulty, then the check is a **success**. If the result was less than the difficulty, then the check is a **failure**.

Some types of checks may have additional mechanics. For example, when an [attack check](#attack-checks) succeeds by 3 or more, then the attack is a critical hit and inflicts additional damage.

#### Attribute Checks

The most common type of check is an attribute check, which uses one of the character's attribute bonuses as the check bonus. For example, a Power check uses the character's Power bonus, while a Speed check uses the character's Speed bonus.

> **Example**
>
> While exploring the basement of Bowser's Keep, the party discovers a puzzle of arcane knowledge. Solving the puzzle requires a successful Magic check with a difficulty of 12. As the character with the highest magic, Donatello attempts to solve the puzzle and rolls two six-sided dice, getting a 3 and a 5 for a **roll** of 8. He also adds the **bonus**, which is his Magic value of 5. The **check result** is 13, which is greater than or equal to the **difficulty** of 12, so the check is a success. A hidden panel slides open, revealing the lost Wand of Kamek.

> **Example**
>
> The party is being chased through the sewers by a giant Goomba. Leonardo spots a lever that will close the sewer grate behind them, but the lever is rusty and stuck. The Narrator decides that this is a Power check with a difficulty of 10. Leonardo rolls two six-sided dice and gets a 2 and a 3, for a **roll** of 5. He also adds the **bonus**, which is his Power value of 4. The **check result** is 9, less than the **difficulty** of 10, so the check is a failure. He heaves heroically at the lever, but it refuses to budge as the giant Goomba barrels into the room...

#### Making Checks As A Group

Determining who in a party can or needs to perform a check can be difficult. Here are some suggestions on how to adjudicate different situations.

- **Everyone Rolls:** Use this rule when the effect of a success or failure is independent for each character. For example, a falling rocks trap would require a separate Defense check for each party member caught in the area.
- **Lowest Bonus Rolls:** Use this rule when any character failing the check would cause the entire party to fail. The classic example for this rule would be sneaking past a set of guards; determine which character has the lowest Speed value, and have that character roll for the entire group.
- **Highest Bonus Rolls:** Use this rule when any character succeeding at the check would cause the entire party to succeed. In the example above with the magical puzzle, Donatello makes the check for the party because he has the highest Magic value.

#### Assisting Other Characters

Whether or not other characters can assist in a check is left to the Narrator's discretion. As a general rule, each additional helper adds +1 to the check result. Thus, if Michaelangelo or Rafael had stayed to help Leonardo pull the rusty lever, their combined efforts would (just barely) have succeeded in time.

#### Attacking An Enemy

##### Attack Checks

To attack an enemy, a character must make a successful Attack check. Unless specified otherwise by the equipped weapon, an Attack check uses the character's Power bonus, and its difficulty is equal to the target's Defense score.

Once you've rolled the attack check, compared the check result to the difficulty.

- If the check result is less than the difficulty, then the attack misses the target. The target takes no damage, and does not suffer any other effects of the attack.
- If the check result is greater than or equal to the difficulty, then the attack hits the target, and the target takes the amount of damage specified for the weapon (usually 1 point).
- If the result exceeds the difficulty by 3 or more, then the attack is a critical hit, and inflicts double the amount of damage specified for the weapon.

For example, consider an attack against a difficulty of 10. A result of 9 or below would result in a miss. A result of 10 to 12 would result in a regular hit. And a result of 13 or more would result in a critical hit, inflicting double damage.

##### Attacks And Weapons

Some weapons may use a different attribute bonus, or use a different attribute as the check difficulty. For example, a Wand may use the character's Magic bonus instead of Power, and may attack the target's Speed, rather than the target's Defense.

##### Making Full Attacks

Unless otherwise specified, making a Full Attack with a weapon requires making an attack check against the target with the given bonus and difficulty. For example, to resolve a Hammer's Full Attack, make a single attack check against the target. On a successful hit, inflict +1 point of additional point of damage, or +2 points on a critical hit.

##### Multiple Attacks

Some weapons or techniques allow the character to perform multiple attacks as part of a single action. For each attack, make a separate attack check and resolve the results as normal. For example, the Punch Gloves weapon allows the wielder to attempt a second attack as part of a normal attack action on a successful hit, and the Slingshot weapon's Full Attack action allows the wielder to make two separate attacks against a single target.

##### Unarmed Attacks

If a character does not have a weapon equipped, they can make an Unarmed attack. Unarmed attacks use the character's Power bonus, and their difficulty is equal to the target's Defense score. They inflict 1 point of damage on a successful hit, and do not have a Full Attack option.
