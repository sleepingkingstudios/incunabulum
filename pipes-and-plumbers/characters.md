# [Pipes and Plumbers]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers)

## Character Basics

Characters in the *Pipes and Plumbers* system do not have individual attributes such as Dexterity or Charisma, nor does the system implement character progression in the form of classes or point buy mechanics. Instead, a character is defined by three things:

First, each character has a set of **[techniques](#techniques)**. Each technique either grants the character a new [action]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#action) (such as a special attack) or modifies how an existing action is performed or resolved (such as empowering a particular weapon or consumable item).

Second, each character has a set of **[equipment](#equipment)**, or permanent gear such as weapons or armor. Equipment comes in three varieties: weapons, armor, and accessories. Characters can also collect limited-use consumable [items]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#item).

- **Weapons** are used to attack enemies.
- **Armor** provide protection against enemy attacks.
- **Accessories** are a catch-all category for different effects.

Third, each character has a set of **[attributes](#attributes)**. These represent the character's numerical strengths and weaknesses. For example, the **power** attribute is used when attacking an opponent, while the **speed** attribute is used to determine turn order. A character's calculated values can be modified by equipment, by techniques, or by environmental effects.

Together with the [standard actions]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#standard-actions), a character's **techniques** and **equipment** define *what the character can do*. Conversely, the character's **attributes** determine *how well the character does it*.

Finally, each character has both a current and a maximum value for [Hit Points](#hit-points) or HP (reflecting health and vitality) and [Flower Points](#flower-points) or FP (used to power special abilities).

### Attributes

Each character has four **attributes**: [Power](#power), [Defense](#defense), [Speed](#speed), and [Magic](#magic). For each attribute, the character has both an **attribute bonus** and an **attribute score**.

The **attribute bonus** is used for making [Attribute checks]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#attribute-checks). Each bonus is a number, typically in the range of +1 to +6, with a bonus of +3 considered an "average" value. For example, when making an [attack check]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#attack-checks), the character adds their Power bonus to the check.

The **attribute score** is a static value used as the check difficulty when making checks against that character. The score is calculated by adding 7 to the attribute bonus; a character with an average bonus of 3 would have a score of 10. For example, the difficulty of an attack check is equal to the target's Defense score.

#### Power

The **Power** attribute represents a character's physical might. When a character makes an attack check, they add their Power bonus to the check.

#### Defense

The **Defense** attribute represents a character's protection from physical harm. Attacks against a character use the character's Defense score as the check difficulty.

#### Speed

The **Speed** attribute represents how fast a character can move and react. The [turn order]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#turn-order) of a combat round is determined by the characters' speed attributes.

#### Magic

The **Magic** attribute represents a character's arcane power. Many special abilities use the character's Magic bonus.

### Hit Points

A character's **Hit Points** (or HP) represent the character's health and vitality.

Each character has both a **current hit points**, representing their present state, and a **maximum hit points**, which reflects their peak level of health. Unless specified otherwise, references to a character's "hit points" will always refer to their current hit points value.

A character's current hit points is a numeric value between 0 and their maximum hit points, inclusive. The character loses hit points when they take [damage]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#damage), and recover hit points when they receive [healing]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#healing) or [take a rest]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#resting). If the character's hit points are ever reduced to zero, they are [downed]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#downed-characters) and unable to act.

### Flower Points

A character's **Flower Points** (or FP) represent's the character's energy and vigor.

Each character has both a **current flower points**, representing their present state, and a **maximum flower points**, which reflects their peak level of energy. Unless specified otherwise, references to a character's "flower points" will always refer to their current flower points value.

A character's current flower points is a numeric value between 0 and their maximum flower points, inclusive. Characters can spend flower points to power special attacks and abilities, and recover flower points by [resting]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/running-the-game#resting) or using certain [items]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#items). There is no penalty for running out of flower points, aside from being unable to use abilities that require them.
