# [Pipes and Plumbers]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers)

## Character Basics

Characters in the *Pipes and Plumbers* system do not have individual attributes such as Dexterity or Charisma, nor does the system implement character progression in the form of classes or point buy mechanics. Instead, a character is defined by three things:

First, each character has a set of **[techniques](#techniques)**. Each technique either grants the character a new [action]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#action) (such as a special attack) or modifies how an existing action is performed or resolved (such as empowering a particular weapon or consumable item).

Second, each character has a set of **[equipment](#equipment)**, or permanent gear such as weapons or armor. Equipment comes in three varieties: weapons, armor, and accessories. Characters can also collect limited-use consumable [items]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#item).

- **Weapons** are used to attack enemies.
- **Armor** provide protection against enemy attacks.
- **Accessories** are a catch-all category for different effects.

Finally, each character has a set of **[calculated values](#calculated-values)**. These represent the character's numerical strengths and weaknesses. For example, the **power** value is used when attacking an opponent, while the **speed** value is used to determine turn order. A character's calculated values can be modified by equipment, by techniques, or by environmental effects.

Together with the [standard actions]({{site.baseurl}}/pipes-and-plumbers/glossary#standard-actions), a character's **techniques** and **equipment** define *what the character can do*. Conversely, the character's **calculated values** determine *how well the character does it*.

### Calculated Values

Each character has four **calculated values**: [Power](#power), [Defense](#defense), [Speed](#speed), and [Magic](#magic). Additionally, each character has both a *current* [hit points](#hit-points) value and a *maximum* hit points, as well as a *current* [flower points](#flower-points) value and a *maximum* flower points.
