### Light Armor

#### Padded Armor

Padded armor is composed of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Worn by itself, padded armor typically extends to just below the knees. It is also worn as a first layer underneath most metal armor, where it is referred to as an arming doublet or *gambeson*.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Leather Jacket

A reinforced leather jacket that has been treated with alchemical compounds to give it increased strength without sacrificing flexibility.

Leather without the alchemical treatment should be considered Padded Armor.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Mail Shirt

Mail armor is composed of interlocking metal rings, which provide decent protection against most weapons. Contrary to the bards' tales, a mail shirt is worn over a padded jacket for additional protection, not to muffle the sound.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Leather Coat

A full-length coat or duster of alchemically treater leather. Undeniably stylish, but it does restrict movement for the most agile wearers.

Even though a leather coat is light armor, characters with the Medium Armor Mastery feat can add 3, rather than 2, to their AC if they have a Dexterity of 16 or higher.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Medium Armor

#### Hardened Leather

Armor shaped from stiffened leather. Although lighter and cheaper than metal, it provides significantly worse protection, and is more constrictive than alchemically treater leather.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Scale Armor

Scale armor is composed of many small armor plates or scales attached to a cloth or leather backing.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Mail Hauberk

A mail shirt with sleeves and extending past the knees, worn over a padded jacket or doublet (called a *haubergeon* or "little hauberk").

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Brigandine

A coat of heavy cloth of leather, lined internally with metal plates riveted to the fabric. A brigandine is worn over a gambeson and a mail shirt. Lamellar armor (composed of small metal plates that connect to each other, rather than a separate backing) also fall into this category.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Heavy Armor

#### Breastplate

A fitted metal chestpiece worn over a mail shirt.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Half Plate

A breastplate and backplate, with segmented plates covering the upper thigh and spaulders covering the shoulders and upper arms.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Plate Armor

A suit of shaped metal plates that interlock to cover the entire body, worn over a mail hauberk and haubergeon.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Shields

A character wielding a shield and with proficiency in shields can use the Attack action to bash an enemy with the shield. Treat the shield as a melee weapon with the specified damage and properties, if any. If the shield has the light property, you can use the shield as a light weapon for the purposes of two-weapon fighting.

#### Small Shield

A small shield of metal or wood, such as a dueling buckler. A light shield counts as a light weapon when making a shield bash attack.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Medium Shield

A larger shield such as a round or kite shield.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Tower Shield

A very large shield that covers most of the body. Wielding a tower shield requires proficiency in heavy armor as well as shields.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Masterwork Armor

Masterwork armor is of surpassing quality, allowing for a greater range of motion. The maximum Dexterity modifier when wearing masterwork armor is increased by 1. A masterwork mail hauberk has an Armor Class of 14 + Dex modifier (max 3), while a masterwork suit of half plate has an Armor Class of 17 + Dex modifier (max 1). This stacks with other effects that improve the maximum Dexterity modifier, such as the *Medium Armor Master* feat.

A set of masterwork armor costs five times as much as the same armor of average quality, and must be commissioned from a master artisan. Masterwork armor can be adapted for another wearer, but this likewise requires work from a master artisan and costs 20% of the cost of commissioning a new set. For example, a masterwork chain hauberk would cost 500 gold to commission, or 100 gold to adjust to fit a new wearer.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Armor Variants

#### Leather Armor

Certain types of metal armor including scale armor, brigandine, and breastplates can be crafted from hardened leather instead of metal. Substituting leather reduces the cost by 75% and removes the penalty to Stealth checks, but reduces the Armor Class of the armor by 1.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Whisper Oil

An alchemical treatment used to deaden the sound of metal armor, whisper oil can be applied to any suit of armor which applies disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Treated armor no longer applies the penalty to Stealth checks. Treating armor requires a skilled alchemist, and costs gold equal to the purchase price of the armor.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

#### Exotic Materials

In addition to leather and iron, armor can be crafted from a wide range of materials. Some materials are functionally identical (using high-quality bronze instead of iron). Some are cosmetic, such as a suit of tiger skin armor treated to serve as a leather coat; such armor may have a higher price and resale value. A few materials, such as mithril and adamantium, are sufficiently rare that they are considered magical items.

Certain materials may provide additional benefits, particularly those crafted from magical creatures. Wild elven leaf armor is said to make the wearer almost invisible in forested settings, while plate armor crafted from the shells of giant crabs can allow the wearer to breathe underwater and swim as if unencumbered. Other materials may provide additional protection against certain threats, such as a leather coat crafted from the hide of a hell hound alpha might grant its wearer resistance to fire damage.

[Back to Armor](#armor-and-shields) \| [Back to Top](#)

## Weapons

### Masterwork Weapons

Masterwork weapons are of surpassing quality, allowing for increased lethality in skilled hands. Masterwork weapons use a damage die one size larger than normal, or a die of 2d6 if the damage die is a d12. A masterwork dagger deals 1d6 piercing damage, a masterwork greataxe deals 1d12 slashing damage, and a masterwork maul deals 2d8 bludgeoning damage.

A masterwork weapon costs ten times as much as the same weapon of average quality, with a minimum of 100 gold, and must be commissioned from a master artisan. Masterwork weapons can be adapted for another wielder, but this likewise requires work from a master artisan and costs 20% of the cost of commissioning a new item. For example, a masterwork longsword would cost 150 gold to commission, or 30 gold to adjust to fit a new wearer.

### Alchemist's Fire

As an action, you can throw a flask of alchemist's fire up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 fire damage.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Alchemist's Fire, Lingering

This alchemist's fire has been mixed with a sticky naphtha and clings to whatever it touches. In addition to the inital damage, the target takes 1d6 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw (or 10 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier + the alchemist's proficiency bonus) to extinguish the flames.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Alchemist's Frost

A flask of alchemist's frost actually contains two substances, with one encased in a smaller vial inside the flask. WHen mixed, the two react by freezing their surroundings. As an action, you can throw a flask of alchemist's frost up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's frost as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage. If the target is a creature, its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Bottled Lightning

A tube of copper with an amber inlay, containing a powerful electric charge. As an action, you can make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottled lightning as an improvised weapon. You have advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Essence Of Magic Beans

This potion is derived from "magic beans" through a secretive and elaborate process. The result is very bitter, but gives a jolt of energy. When you drink the potion, you can add 1d4 to an ability check made before the end of your next turn. This does not stack with the *guidance* cantrip.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Thunderstone

A small piece of alchemically treated quartz. In a dark room, it flickers faintly as if from captured lightning. A broken thunderstone releases its energy in a burst of sound. As an action, you can throw a thunderstone up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, tresting the thunderstone as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 thunder damage.

[Back to Adventuring Gear](#adventuring-gear) \| [Back to Top](#)

### Thunderstone, Overcharged

This thunderstone has been charged to dangerous levels. In addition to the initial damage, the target and all adjacent creatures must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw (or 10 + the alchemist's Intelligence modifier + the alchemist's proficiency bonus) or take 1d6 points of lightning damage, even if the initial attack is a miss.
